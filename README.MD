📌 Description:
This project focuses on automating the classification of mental health-related text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It aims to analyze written statements and predict the underlying mental health status (such as signs of depression, stress, or stability) to assist early detection and intervention.

🔍 Objectives:
Preprocess user-generated text by removing stopwords, lemmatizing, and extracting features.
Vectorize cleaned text using TF-IDF to convert it into numerical format.
Train and evaluate classification models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
Provide an interactive input system to classify new, unseen text for mental health insights.
⚙️ Key Components:
NLP Preprocessing: Sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) using NLTK and spaCy.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorization to numerically represent text.
Models Used:
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix.
User Input Module: Accepts user-written text and classifies it using the trained model in real-time.
📂 Dataset:
Sourced from a Mental_Health_Dataset.csv file containing labeled user statements related to mental health status.
🚀 Technologies:
Python, NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
