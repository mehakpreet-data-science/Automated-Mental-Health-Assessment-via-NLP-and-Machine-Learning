I would have listened in the past.

I think it would be in my best interest to tell them I’m looking forward to it because I am.

35494,Worried I have ovarian cancer. The more I'm on social media the more I hear about 'silent killer' cancers. I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane. ,Anxiety

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

52954,"Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",Anxiety
34675,"Helpful starter links for dealing with Health Anxiety **EDIT: I have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. I have now included all of them for you :)**

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

So tonight (since it's a Sunday and I can't call my doctor yet again :p), I decided to look for some self help. Through a google search I came across these .pdfs that have already brought some comfort to me, in the short few minutes I've been working with them.  Apparently, there are 9 modules, but I have only been able to locate modules 1-3, 6, and 8-9 (missing 4, 5, and 7).  I am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, I'd figure I'd share these with you, friends.  Hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

34289,"My health anxiety caused me to get a CT scan and now my anxiety is in overdrive over radiation risks I am a hypochondriac but this time I have been having some severe abdominal pain for 2 weeks. It's constant, not one second of peace, sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors, blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy, which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing (although, I don't really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.

How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening, at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.",Anxiety

51926,"Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

For reference, it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldn’t seem to go away. I’m currently living in Spain, which is where I’m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted, lots of mucus coming out, constipation, tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January, the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark, and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldn’t see clearly, but my other organs looked good. But then, my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool, found something that looked like a worm, went to the emergency room, tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
Just after my first dose of mebendazole, I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldn’t breathe in all the way, but that was it. Anyway, in addition to that, I began to have sinus pressure, a mild sore throat, and drainage. 
I took my second dose of the worm medicine, had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood), and even a chest X-ray that was clear. I’ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up, I’ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I haven’t been able to completely shake this cold yet and it’s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse, I’m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then, last night, I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. 

I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times, as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field; scientists, real politicians, essential jobs, etc.

I feel useless, and I feel really unmotivated to keep on working for my master's thesis.",Anxiety

I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys?

34431,"Rabies Anxiety I’ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently I’ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbor’s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didn’t want them to get in a fight so I shoo’d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that I’m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn’t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesn’t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that I’ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive.

34894,"Proud of Myself Hi everyone! It's been a while since I posted on this sub and I really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.

So this past summer I was active on here all the time. I was convinced I had a brain tumour, bone cancer, blood clots, and a bunch of other issues. 

I ended up starting therapy in September and it's been going great! I've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance (i.e. going to the ER) and dealing with my fear of death. I still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms, but I can honestly say I'm starting to get better.

Anyways, I feel like I had a major milestone today - even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. 

My health anxiety is mostly focused on myself, but also extends to other people I care about, like my family. So naturally, when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering, I panicked. Like full blown panic. I immediately thought the worst (shocker), especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. That week waiting for results was excruciating (thankfully it was just benign cysts). Naturally, this brought me back to that terrible week of worry, and I was immediately thinking that, despite 2 mammograms + an ultrasound not even two full months ago, that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.

My initial instinct was to google - I tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like I have some control over the situation. I was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer, likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer, and the like. I had intentions of reassuring myself, but I also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. Despite how badly I wanted to do research, I forced myself to ignore the compulsion. I was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion (i.e. family history of cystic breasts = likelihood of cyst vs. cancer)

Thankfully, our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram, but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. He's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe, but overall isn't worried.

However, despite all this, I feel really proud of myself! I managed to avoid Googling because I knew it would harm me, even if I was convinced it would help me. I really feel like I accomplished something, and I hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. Therapy has been a godsend for me, even if it's just in small steps like this.",Anxiety

34879,"Rabies HA is driving me batty Hi fellow anxiety sufferers

&amp;#x200B;

I've been good for months but my HA has decided to welcome the new year with a flare up. A few nights ago I was reading in my bedroom with the window open, when I heard some rustling/flapping at the curtain. I went to take a look and couldn't see anything except for two large geckos. I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain, causing the rustling, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head, when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything, and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story kinda short, I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room, snuck up on me, nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away – this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds, but nonetheless, the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot, the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low, and apparently fewer than 0.5% of the bat population is rabid. So...

I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound (such as my fridge, PC, anything really) will seem to grow louder and seem eerie/spooky. My thoughts go down this loop of ""Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will I feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird (and super brief) thoughts of doing rash things (flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example). It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, I feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add, is over the summer I did acid for the first time, and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

So starting Monday morning my right leg (thigh just above the ankle) started to hurt in a weird mix of a cramp and DOMS like way. The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.

This morning I went to my GP who measured my legs, and examined them with her hands.

I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all &lt;3",Anxiety

52636,"Psychiatrist or psychologist? (F,22) TW: self harm, suicide


Hey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.

Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my relationship/my partner/me etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine, I didn't have any reason to feel like this.

In january I started to feel a bit better (anxiety wise), but I started to self harm again (I don't do this constantly, only once or twice every few months I guess). In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. 

I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is, therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho, but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.

Do you have any advice regarding my situation? Any response would be much appreciated.",Anxiety

35682,"I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.

Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, ""I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap"". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes ""severe"" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.

I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.",Anxiety
34005,"I feel really silly posting this but... I think I’ll feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety, although it’s not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them, and I think I’ve gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.

But I don’t think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow, and I’m trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but I’m still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think I’ve done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But I’m going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.

Close to a year ago now, I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup, the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didn’t have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons, I didn’t see a doctor until about eight months later, when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a (swollen) lymph node. Abscess was drained, tested positive for Staph, I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long, and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice, told me he couldn’t feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldn’t feel it anymore. 

Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but it’s still around. And now above it there’s a new...mass. It’s next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit (sorry for the bad explanation). It’s a hard lump and fixed in place, which freaks me out a bit because google says that’s a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe it’s just my muscle I’m feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that “bump” thing going on at the top, but it’s way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump, if that makes sense. And it feels like it’s growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. 

I feel like such a drama queen. I’m so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because I’m so used to being dismissed and them thinking I’m a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isn’t much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety can’t cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just can’t cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think I’m an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor (for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me) and I’m debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and non-judgy, these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know.

-Pulmonary embolism
-Heart attacks
-Angina
-Stomach Ulcers

-Insomnia
-Shortness of breath
-Palpitations
-Racing thoughts
-Indigestion 
-Tight aching muscles
-Dizziness

-Checking for symmetry 
-pushing and prodding where I felt it hurt until it did hurt 
-Twisting and turning until I felt that symptom again
-Avoiding anything that I believed would make my symptoms worse (flying, eating certain foods, exercising too much or too little)
-and most importantly googling for the exact scenario I believed to be true e.g. 'headache above left ear associated with brain cancer' or 'sore achilles hill sign of DVT'

I have (literally) spent $1000's on:

-GP's (who always tell me the same thing)
-Physios
-Chiros
-Missed work
-Miracle cures (e.g. magnesium, vitamin B, etc...)
-Dietitians
-Ambulances

All to conquer my 'Sicknesses' 

The reality is though...

I was sick in 2012, I was truly diagnosed with Graves disease,

and although very treatable (and it has been treated).

it scared me to my core.

I became overaware of every sensation in my body and thought in my mind.

I believed that I needed to be aware to ensure I would survive.

This habit manifested itself into my true and worst alement health anxiety.

Health anxiety has stole time and experiences from me for 5 years.

It made me doubt myself.

It made me loathe myself.

It crippled me. 

However, I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.

But it has taken effort, commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still (at least for the time being) and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.

Some days it still wins, but with each month those days get less and less.

My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am.

I've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kid,but this past month I have  been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable, but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.
Instead, I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.


The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancy(which is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october, and the circumstances made 
 pregnancy very unlikely),after PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago, I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative, which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovaries,and because of this I worry that  she could have missed it if it  was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms, pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.

I know this probably sounds crazy, but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?",Anxiety

Since last fall, I’ve had chest/ abdominal pain. Doctor thought it was GERD, but I haven’t responded to multiple PPI’s. I recently had a full cardiology workup and it was clear. Normally cardiology tests would really excite me, but this time I honestly didn’t think it was my heart.

The pain is worsening and I’m so discouraged. It’s a constant burning and I can’t find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. I’m beginning to think they’ll never find out what’s wrong. It’s almost to the point I want pain medicine, and that’s not me.

I do realize the impact anxiety can have, especially on the digestive system, but I’m in constant pain. It feels like there’s more to this. I’m fearful of tests continuing to come back normal, they’ll blame my anxiety and depression and I’ll continue to suffer. Thanks for listening.

Anyways, since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors.

Like, I'm clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. Also, when handing the change to the customer (I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear.

I've always suffered from severe anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and depression(to less of an extent), I remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.

Anyway, just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer, and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when I was young, so I have a warped perception of how common it is, I guess. Aside from this my life has been filled with death, my father is terminally Ill, my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning, my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death, more beyond this, grandparents, friends' parents, uncles and aunts.

My anxiety since starting uni has worsened, I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 24/7, extreme worrying thoughts all the time, trembling hands, especially bad at night. 

I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues, it's literally just headaches, for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots, never a full over generalised headache, it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears, and this happens a few times through the day. 
The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen, I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi, at which point my thoughts went rampant.

I just feel like my anxiety is killing me, and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely, as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. 

EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing, but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over, I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

I'm feeling exhausted and hopeless from the unending cycle of costly medical tests which produce little effect on my anxiety. Your advice is appreciated.",Anxiety
52854,"Crazy how powerful thought diaries &amp; breathing techniques have been for my anxiety  I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",Anxiety

51939,I had a mini win ! Hello everyone I hope you’re okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and it’s perfect so I know it’s not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think it’s more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being I’ll and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now I’m not saying I’m perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I can’t stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isn’t a god I won’t know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We don’t know so it’s the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say I’m a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now I’m religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I don’t wanna die soon that’s why I’m scared off. That’s just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me.

35382,"Wanted to share one of my coping methods in case any of you find it helpful Recently I've been thinking a lot about about my health anxiety and I think one of the main reasons why I am so afraid of contracting whatever disease it happens to be on any given week, is because I automatically catastrophize the situation. 

If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because I've died young. To reassure myself, I tell myself that I'm making it up it my head, I don't have cancer, it's so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another 'symptom' and the cycle continues.

But lately I've been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. 

By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from 'I don't have x disease, I'm OK' to 'I probably don't have x disease, but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok', I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to.

Nonetheless, on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo, then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didn’t touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands, I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I can’t be sure.

Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What’s important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that’s okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she’s been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she’s out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn’t planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she’s in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I’m full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I’m just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she’s fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a “Get Well Soon” card, being given to her by another teacher she’s friends with. I don’t really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I’d also like to say that I KNOW she’s fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I’m not actively doing something distracting.

I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA, concentrated around having a heart condition. 

I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. 

I’ve been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately I’ve felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure, and it’s been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself, but have been able to start exercising again, which feels great. 

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin, which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. 

Today I’ve been feeling anxious the entire day, I’ve resisted taking klonopin again because I don’t want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and I’m afraid I’m falling back into my old ways.

So after this incident I’ve monitored every ache and pain, every strange feeling, every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f, and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesn’t help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily, my arms, shoulders, back, and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.

I am scheduling an appointment with my GP, but I’m hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling, as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor, unfamiliar twinge in my body. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

52068,"Perhaps the battle with my extreme self consciousness will only end when I end The moment I step outside, I become too aware of the way I walk, the way my arms are moving when I walk, where my eyes are looking at, how I'm blinking, my jaw position, my neck position, my posture. Basically the way I'm looking to another person (I try to picture myself how I might be looking and whether it's not wierd). Sometimes I record myself with a phone to see what's the oddity with my behaviour.

The reason this has developed is because from class 5-6 I realised there was something wrong... People would keep a stare once they got a glance of me. I realise, in retrospect, that's because I looked like a girl even though I'm a boy. Perhaps some hormones got messed up and I got some feminine features like long eye lashes, girly lips, girl type face, curved hip, short height.

35213,"3 weeks of crazy medical symptoms and scared out of my mind Not sure where to even start. 

Around Christmas time I was drinking pretty heavily and abusing phenibut pretty bad. Once I returned back to work I slowly tapered everything down, but still had lingering vertigo and dizziness. I went to the occupational nurse and explained this to her so she sent me to the ER after seeing my blood pressure through the roof. 

EKG, chest x-ray and blood work all came back okay. Blood pressure a little on the high side but no big deal. 

A few days goes by and I'm noticing my eye is driving me nuts, like it's super dry and irritated. I keep checking it and it looks fine. Check it again and I notice my eyebrow is hanging lower than normal so I panic because I'm thinking stroke and go to the ER. Get halfway there and get this rush of a weird taste in my mouth and I suddenly feel super weak and out of it. My head feels like it's expanding and I can't string a sentence together and my neck and shoulder muscles feel like they're all as tense as they possibly can be. Ambulance takes me to the ER, get EKG, chest x-ray and blood work and they give me a xanax and send me home saying it was a panic attack. 

Next time I'm in the ER it's the same thing. I start noticing my neck muscles are super tense and my heart is pounding and I try to keep calm for as long as possible, but it doesn't go away so I go to the ER again. CT scan, blood work and a small dose of ativan and I'm fine. 

Third time I convince myself sudden proptosis. PANIC. Go to the ER again, same symptoms. My head feels like it's rushing with fluid, neck muscles are insanely tense and I'm freaking out. Checks my eye pressure and gives a quick exam and I'm fine. 

Go see my regular doc and I keep explaining to him it's not anxiety. Never had attacks like these in my life. Did the usual neurological tests when I explained fear of a stroke and it was all fine. He asked me to smile. Asked me to really smile. Explained to him my left arm had been feeling a little weaker than normal and my armpit felt almost numb or inflamed. So he ordered an MRI because he said it felt colder than the other. 

Came home and checked my smile in the mirror and noticed the right side of my face is pretty much paralyzed. I can barely smile, but I can close my eye. My eyebrow hangs lower than the left and my cheek sags a little. I called the ER doc and she said it's probably Bell's Palsy. Probably a ~3 week timeframe. 

So I'm terrified I have a tumor or MS or something. I did have a CT scan that came back clean. The only symptom I still have is the drooping on my face. I keep thinking my left arm feels weak, but I'm not even really sure. It's like the more I focus on it the worst it gets, but otherwise I don't really notice it. Maybe it feels mildly colder. 

Right now my balance is fine. I find my self falling asleep for a few seconds at a time randomly when I'm at my desk, but I sleep like shit because of anxiety. When I'm sitting down I get these weird feelings like someone's walking up the stairs, like you can feel it in your butt from the vibrations, but nothing's actually happening. My vision has been blurry for the past two years, but my eye doctor said it's nothing to be concerned about. 

I don't even know. My doctor is out until the beginning of March and all I want are my MRI results so I know what's going on. Are these panic attacks, is this just bell's palsy brought on my all of the stress of the past three weeks?

I'm fucking terrified. Sorry for the rant. ",Anxiety

Hi all. i literally just found this reddit 20 minutes and, im already. extremely thankful for it, I've suffered with bouts of health anxiety on and off for years and its been one of the most soul crushing things to experience in my life. Lately since I got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. I'm a massive worrier in general, its terrible but Im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and DVT thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it (and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain I just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because I've recently developed a lump in my neck (most likely frm flu). its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery, we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it (we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it) who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it , she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been  like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have  clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be!!! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im  making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down, im sorry i guess, i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. I'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but I have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassed/ashamed/upset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond",Anxiety
52818,"every strange thing that’s happened in the last 24 hours. please read . 14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do.",Anxiety

6’1” 275lbs

Pack a day smoker for ~10 years

No chronic health conditions or regular meds

Current meds: 20mg prednisone 3x a day for 5 days, albuterol inhaler as needed (up until last night I’d been using it every 4 hours regardless)

On Wednesday (5 days ago) I went to urgent care because I’d been feeling some chest discomfort. My son has recently gotten over walking pneumonia so I wanted to get it checked out and start treatment early if that’s what I had. They did a chest x-ray, took blood, did a peak flow test where I scored a 300. Doc gave me a breathing treatment and bumped the peak flow score to 450. Doc said, “I’m gonna call it bronchitis” and prescribed me the meds listed above.

In the beginning, I didn’t feel sick; I wasn’t rundown or tired, no fever, no loss of appetite or anything. Ever since I went to the doctor I’ve felt weird. I wake up feeling shaky, I get dizzy throughout the day, for the first few days my lower legs were killing me, I get these random waves of feeling hot/flushed, and I wake up several times throughout the night either cold or burning up (still no fever, no chills). I feel like the prednisone should be giving me some improvement but the cough is becoming more frequent and more productive (white sputum). Last night it took me forever to fall asleep because the center of my chest hurt. 

I’ve slowed down on my smoking since going to the doctor but haven’t totally stopped. I’m just so afraid that this is something more serious.

34125,"Nervous about pain in throat after eating garlic &amp; venting Hi everybody,

So I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then, I’ve had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. I’ve developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.

Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold, I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. I’ve done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. I’ve noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However, this time, I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the pain/burning sensation. Even my chest started hurting, which never usually happens to me. 

I’m embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and I’m already catastrophizing everything (ie I’ve burned a hole through my throat, this will somehow lead to death, etc). I’m hoping the symptoms  go down within the next couple of hours, otherwise, the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.

In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why can’t I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasn’t so afraid all the time, I wouldn’t have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse (I’m an expert at that).

52342,"Relentless Nightmare since December! Hello all,

I am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it’s something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn’t sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I’ve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..

Since then I’ve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I’ve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I’d say it’s fair to diagnose as anxiety-related… though my therapist (I’m new to therapy since this all began) says he’s never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I’d say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I’m still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn’t thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.

Overall I would say I am at about 25-30%. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 0-5% honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.

I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what I’m trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily, get outside, drive to my apartment (1hr), and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I’m busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it’s own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they’re not. It’s like being stuck in a dreaming state and it’s so scary and frustrating. It’s very hard to describe but I don’t have any delusions or hallucinations so I don’t believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. 

I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees, a long distance relationship, a breakup, and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I’d have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it’s easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. I’ve learned lessons in gratitude, kindness, and compassion that I want to share with others.

P.S.
I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once I’m better: bodybuilding, soccer, vinyls, and working!",Anxiety

Current fears that have come and gone:

-Heart Attack
-Heart arrhythmia
-Cancer (Brain)
-ALS or some motor-neuron disease

My current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible?

34088,"Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th (almost 2 weeks ago) I pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.

I went about my night (my birthday night) without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut/scraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again, I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated, but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.

Fast forward to today, January 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly, docile, and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.

I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that ""He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something"". My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much, but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.

Edit: I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already, It still bugs me though.",Anxiety

52832,"Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time.

52805,"Redditors with trust issues due to childhood trauma, how do you cope and build trust with others? am a 19-year-old college student, trying to make the best of my life despite my past. Growing up, I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone, but it never worked.

My mom was an alcoholic, and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world, and I had no one to turn to.

As a result of my childhood, I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way, just like my father and stepfather did.

But despite all of this, I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me, and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.

However, even with my newfound friendships, I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length, afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.

Sometimes, I wish I could forget about my past and start anew, but it's always there in the back of my mind, haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before, so the appointment is a bit of a blur, but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.

I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach, even if it's not what I would have chosen.

I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time - like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother - but, for example, I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted, I was drinking a lot over that period, but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.

I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money, hardly slept (or sometimes even didn't) for days at a time, and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught.

45692,"Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may, do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?


Here's some (not super necessary for answering my questions) background:

I have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate, I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.

While I had had many sort of hypo-hypomanic periods before, and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13, my first full blown, classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. (I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants.) The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle, so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.

I've never had any other side effects, but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.

All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true, is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects, I'd rather not.



So, has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?

I am, of course, not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.

Thank you!",Bipolar

For several years before I was diagnosed I only really experienced depression (no hypomania at all) and it felt like it would never end. And I know that a fair amount of people also feel this way.

47003,"Wondering if I could be bipolar So when I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago my doctor told me to watch for any mania because of my family history with bipolar. I hadn’t had any issues until this year. I’ve always been moody and could change at the drop of a hat. But I never considered that abnormal for me.
I had one experience a few weeks ago where I felt I could have been manic. I was at work and just in a great mood, nothing could shake me, overly peppy and talkative. I couldn’t focus very well, my mind was just jumping from thing to thing. My boyfriend who works with me pointed out that I wasn’t acting normal after I had already kind of noticed the elevated mood myself. I was trying not to fixate on it but once he pointed it out it started making me very anxious. 
Since then I’ve been keeping track of my moods with an app because my boyfriend also pointed out that it’s not the only time I’ve acted odd and I sometimes don’t notice it at all. 
I just started seeing a therapist and when I brought this up to her she told me the feeling has to last days to be mania. From what I’ve read hypomania doesn’t have to be long lasting. 
I’m just confused about whether I should be seeking a mood stabilizer because I have been struggling with mood swings. Any opinions would be very helpful for me!",Bipolar

Of course I couldn't concentrate and was fidgety and talking fast. :\

I'm a freshman in college, and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2, GAD, panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks, so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes; I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.

I guess the lithium was working for a while, but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around, talking a mile a minute, everything, and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa.

I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met, but I feel like eventually, he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.

50555,"Are things going to get any better? So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit, but here we go.

About eight months ago, I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life (anxiety, depression) and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist, and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.

I've been on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) since I was diagnosed, and it's made things easier for me, but exam season (last year of high school) is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week, I can't really sleep anymore, and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me, freaking out, or acting friendly, because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired, stressed, occasionally productive, or filled with a kind of self-loathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon, because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people (two of my friends and my immediate family) know that I'm bipolar, and I don't even want to tell **them** about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones, even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone, but I just don't have the energy, and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult (asperger's, yay) and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.

I wanted to ask, does it get any easier? Not to board the self-pity train or anything, but I'm not even 20, and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again. I just... don't know what to do right now.

I just moved back home to be with my family for the next 6 months and I'm trying to figure out how to cope until getting to my new pdoc. 

Surprisingly I have been stabilized on only 12.5 mg of Lamictal (extremely rare-- my body is intensely sensitive to meds, substances, etc.) for the last couple of months. My day to day routine was rather consistent though, so there wasn't that much to throw me off. It's helped more so with my co-morbid BPD mood swings.

But after an 11 hr stressful care ride, change of environment, change of sleep schedule, and moving away from my boyfriend? I'm lost. I'm waking up in a deep depression, don't want to shower, don't want to eat. Then when my loud and boisterous family gets me out of the house I start feeding off of their energy and won't stop talking, become obnoxious at restaurants, speed home, racing thoughts and sweating like crazy, stay up all night, then repeat the next day. Luckily I haven't been doing anything too extreme (yet) but I don't know what to do in the meantime, even right now I feel panicked and sweaty and confused yet worn out and can't find the will to do anything. Not to mention I've been feeling intensely lonely even though I am near my family. 

I start work on Monday, which I'm hoping can add in some needed structure to my day, but at the same time I'm nervous to be adding another facet of change to my life and sending me down more of a spiral. 

I want to get out and distract myself during this weird state but I really can't find the footing and I'm afraid if I stay around my family I'll get worse.

46846,"(Trigger warning) Am I in a mixed episode? I feel like I want to jump out of my own skin, like I want to rip off my limbs. Like everything inside me is wrong - all my bones ache as if they don't fit inside my body, like they want to burst out. Like I want to explode. It's a kind of intense restless agitation to which nothing brings relief. Sometimes I go for a run or bike ride to try calm myself down, but it doesn't have a big effect, and often I end up overexerting myself and get hurt. What appeals to me most in this state is the thought of hurting myself or not living or losing myself in drugs. It's very hard to keep myself from self-harming. I've been in this state for so long and I don't know how much more I can take. In the past I've described it as 'restlessness', because I don't know how else to describe it. But it's clear to me that it's much more than that.

Is this a mixed episode? I've been like this for so long... Sometimes they'll last for one day, sometimes days, sometimes weeks or maybe even months. I'll then have a brief period of respite before returning to the state I've described above. While in this state I can often get into a kind of semi-mania and get things done which I never thought I could - read books, make art, play music, write essays - but always with this horrible exploding depressive restlessness underneath. And it's extremely hard to motivate myself to do anything. But if I curl up in bed or try to calm down with a film or music, my heart begins to pound and shake my entire body, and the restlessness just gets worse and worse and I want to die.

I've tried lots of times to search on the internet for this kind of feeling, but I've never found anything. 
However reading this sub today, I'm struck by how people seem to have had similar sensations. I really didn't think I was Bipolar, because I don't think I have contrasting periods of 'highs' and 'lows'. I might be in a relative 'low', but there will always be the potential for a relative 'high' to emerge quickly out of this low. And vice versa. It's as if everything is there at once, as if I'm in a low and a high at the same time. Always fluctuating, but always wrong. It's awful. It has really impacted all aspects of my life. I've withdrawn from society and do not keep contact with anyone, and when I do meet people they are scared or unnerved by how bizarre my behaviour is.

I know it's unwise to seek opinions on the internet, but at this point in time I have no friends who I can talk to about this, and I don't have the money to see a doctor or psychologist.
If a redditor or two could give their thoughts on my state, it might help point me in the right direction.

I have a full and enriching life, I’ve been really trying to dive into my activities full ass but as soon as I have a second to myself I spiral.

I keep texting her late at night basically crying to her how much I miss her and how much she meant to me.

46717,"I quit smoking weed and my life has gotten way better I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about a year and a half ago, but I havn’t had the opportunity to go on meds yet because I’ve been moving around a lot, lost my insurance, bullshit like that. I started smoking weed for the first time during a manic episode about 6 months ago and smoked nightly no matter what my mood state was. If I was manic I would smoke all day everyday to feel less “up”, and if I was depressed or baseline I smoked to wind down at night or to distract myself from being depressed. I swore by weed and told all my friends it was actually making me more stable, but I see now that I was just numbing my symptoms. 

I was in a manic episode for the last month of these 6 months, this recent February. Every night during this month the smoking started giving me 3 hour panic attacks. It started slowly, maybe the first week I would just get paranoid about stuff like cops, and then I started hearing voices ontop of the paranoia, and then I slowly became convinced that I secretly had some medical issues that could kill me every second, and then finally the last week or two I would smoke and just become completely convinced I would die in my sleep. This even happened at a party, I didn’t even smoke that much but began hearing voices and had to leave the party early. It was humiliating. And being convinced you’re going to die is very traumatizing, especially when it happens night after night. I would be laying in my bed shaking, too high to even cry, and praying to god to forgive me for my sins since I was going to die that night, all while listening to classical music to try and calm down and hearing voices speak over the music. Finally I just said, why the fuck am I paying for weed, paying to have these panic attacks? So I threw it all away. 

This was about a week ago, and I’ve been a week sober for the first time in 6 months. I can already notice myself returning back to normal. I hadn’t realized how much weed was affecting my brain even when I wasn’t high. I have wayyy less anxiety, whereas when I was smoking I was wondering why I was suddenly developing anxiety. I wake up feeling refreshed and not still high from the night before. I don’t think every little ache and pain in my body is secretly cancer or something that’s going to make me magically drop dead. I’m not paranoid about cops busting in and arresting me for no reason. I was derealized for a long time and nothing felt real, and now everything feels real again. I hadn’t realized how fucked up weed was making me. 

I guess I wanted to post this because I’ve seen people on here say the same things I used to swear by, that weed is ok to self medicate with and that it actually reduces your symptoms. If you start getting paranoid when you smoke, you need to stop before it becomes psychotic panic attacks like i was having. I finally feel like I’m returning back to my normal self. I’m not even sad about having to quit like I imagine doing I’d be. I have literally no desire to smoke anymore, I’d do anything if it means I didn’t have to suffer another 3 hour panic attack of hearing voices and saying farewell to the world as I fall asleep and prepare to die. 

So yah, use weed if you want. But be aware that it gets bad very quickly, and likely is affecting you when you’re not high and you don’t even realize it. Take a week off and see what happens. ",Bipolar

  I know for others to accept me, I have to accept myself, I've made a lot of progress in that regard, it may be the best thing I've done for myself in a very long time

45518,"[Rant] I KNEW IT! My medication is poisoning me! I originally posted this over in the /r/CasualConversation Weekly Chat Thread but upon reflection, realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and I feel I'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what I've been dealing with. 

From my original post:

&gt;It'll be 8 years this summer since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of Depakote/Epilum (sodium valporate) for rapid cycling moods and mania. Over the years, I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time, my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant, never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.
 
&gt;As a result, I've had to do my own research and recently, I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me about:

&gt;According to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals, prolonged/long term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused, it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years, this makes sense but no-one told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.

&gt;It can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor (the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis) has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 6-8 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not, let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas, which is typically characterized by intense cramping/pain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had near-daily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.

&gt;Apparently, it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormones/testosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also, I was at child-bearing age (22) when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate, the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again, NO-ONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.

&gt;I am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that if/when I raise these issues with my current psych doctor, she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.

&gt;I know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teeth-grittingly ""polite"" letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it- not literally but y'know- and get my voice heard.

&gt;I want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare (which is often laughably crap at times here), it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.

&gt;Urgh. I'm so angry I could spit fire!",Bipolar
50102,"What’s your relationship between bipolar and chronic pain? I read that BD and chronic pain are commonly paired together, but I haven’t met doctors or therapists who have had experience with both at the same time. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia even before my BD diagnosis. Makes me wonder if it’s really common of if that’s just internet facts. 

Usually, when I wake up with my entire body stiff/in pain, and my energy levels sapped, I’m having a down day. And the opposite is true when I’m elevated. Also, my days of no pain (and not enough sleep) crash into a downward spike, so it makes sense that I wear out because of that.

I got like zero sleep, and am currently wide-awake writing this at 3am, got up and ran some errands that i ususally do with my husband alone because I was annoyed that he was still tired. Like I wanted to kick him in the head because he was still asleep. And in the car I randomly started crying and couldn't stop until i started screaming. When i stopped screaming, I began to cry again - this went on for some time.

45461,"Don't know who to believe.. I was diagnosed BP2 about 2 months ago after a very scary breakdown. I have always had highs and lows, but sometimes reading about Mania is just not what I've ever felt. Maybe its hypomania, but can't that just mean I'm energetic and feeling good? I know I struggle with depression, and have all my life. After I got my diagnosis, I got really up up up and dyed my hair pink- and went out drinking a lot. Is that mania? Or just me? I always have had suicidal thoughts, and my imagination is just really strong. Now the more I read about BP I am learning that some of what I thought was just normal, are my own delusions or hallucinations. Like, not everyone feels like this. Which also makes me question everything. 

Which makes me feel weird. I feel like I don't know who to believe. My psych definitely thinks I have bipolar. My S/O also thinks I have it. However some friends I have told say that I am fine. That I am in a toxic relationship that is making me question my sanity. Now I've got all this lithium cursing through my body that is probably also contributing to me questioning my diagnosis.

47051,"Bipolar w/ ASMR (sidenote on New Age culture &amp; spirituality) Anyone else experiences ASMR on top of your manic episodes? I have type 1 ASMR and Bipolar 1 and I've found it to be a deadly combination. When manic, I'll come up with these metaphysical laws and--despite how compulsive and irrational as fuck they are--  get this huge flood of stimulation from the back of my head all the way to my feet that makes it seem like the universe is confirming my understanding. It got to a point in my development where I believed I was given the date of the end of the world and that the afterlife was split 80% enslaved and 20% saved. 

Months later, my life has blown into ruins and what was once seeming so inexplicably clear now seems psychotic. Is there a lesson to be had from all of this or can it all be written off as manic thinking? 

Sidenote: what's extra complicating on top of all of this is the thirst that new age culture seems to have on pondering spirituality and metaphysics. On the one hand, it's nice that there is a community (albeit niche) that embraces neurodivergence and ""out of the box"" thinking. On the other, I'm finding it dangerous because of the community's willingness to affirm these manic thoughts that Im having as reality. The twofold affirmation had me push towards accepting all these thoughts as absolute truths and burning bridges with people that wouldn't accept what I was experiencing. This ended up being a lot of fucking people and I ended up homeless. 



Yes, I understand that ASMR is a scientifically controversial subject, but it seems there are enough people out there that experience the symptoms of it to talk about it. If you don't know what I'm talking about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response",Bipolar

Although knowing that I suffer from Bipolar II Disorder is disheartening, it is a relief to have a diagnoses and a concrete action plan to manage it. I have suffered from Major Depression since the age of 9; but it wasn't until this week, at the age of 21, that I was diagnosed with BP2 after having a 2.5-week-long hypomanic episode.

During my episode, I displayed all textbook symptoms to varying degrees of destructiveness. Luckily, I did not do anything that had huge lasting consequences. During these 2.5 weeks, I was aware that I was acting abnormally, but I didn't see any problems with it because I felt better than I ever had before while sleeping less than 2 hours each night and eating less than 500 calories per day. When I crashed out of it, I knew that I had to speak with my psychiatrist.

He immediately took me off of my 300mg Wellbutrin (I haven't noticed any withdrawal symptoms yet) and scheduled an appointment with me ASAP. At the appointment, we discussed the many options for medication (anti-psychotics &amp; mood stabilizers). We settled on Depakote and I am now on 500mg for 14 days, then 1000mg for the next 14. At that point, we will meet again and re-evaluate the treatment plan.

It seems like this is a very informative and supportive community. If you all have any advice or resources to offer someone who is starting out on their treatment journey, I'd be happy to hear it. I am especially interested in people's experiences with Depakote, apps that can be used to track mood, and how to build up a support network of friends and family.

46746,"Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!

The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.

I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.

But honestly, I don't feel ""disabled."" I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.

I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word ""disabled,"" its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!

I've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However, during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time - some days better than others - and is sometimes accompanied by muscle aches/sprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.

No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem, but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately, however, I can't find much about long-term usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.

My period has also been coming late every month since meeting them and I have ALWAYS been regular and on time.

I recently had a pdoc retire which meant dealing with the lovely process of finding a new one. It took months and was all around bad. So I finally started seeing this new doc and things are looking better...

Except last week I started getting some side effects from a meds tweak we had agreed on. I wanted to register my experiences with the doctor before they got lost to my utterly fractured memory.

Let me note that over the past decade-plus I have worked with six other pdocs and every single one of them offered two direct contact channels *at least* - a private voicemail box and a private email. They have all been clear that answers were not guaranteed let alone timely, and emergencies always go to 911. Most had a list of on-call staff you could talk to within minutes.

Biggest thing for me is the privacy. Legal implications aside, **I don't want ANYONE reading/listening to the stuff I disclose to my pdoc.**

So here's the kicker. New doc gave me his contact card at initial appointment; so far so good. Dumbass me loses the card. Call receptionist to ask doctor to get in touch, either via email or phone.

I was told that the receptionist is the ""best"" person to email and straight up didn't get an answer to the phone question. Not even a ""we can have the doctor call you when they get a chance.""

On top of this a ton of people are telling me this is MY broken expectations and doctors never give out contact info.

I am so confused, frustrated, angry, and generally miserable about this... And the original side effects are getting worse.

45715,"Possible Misdiagnoses? During the winter of 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar I, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, and a few years earlier ADHD. At first I felt that my diagnoses made sense and I was willing to take my meds. While there were times where I accidentally or deliberately didn't take them, I was mostly consistent. I did in fact feel better in time, though there were many ups and downs. The summer of 2017 I felt that my medications were working amazingly. I was productive, holding a job, writing a book, and overall happy. Beginning my first year of college even started off well. Towards the winter I became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. I expected when our winter break came I would calm down. Throughout the break I had very low energy and a few major mood swings. I convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to California with me in the span of a few hours. I felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. Once we got there I was back to feeling depressed and unhappy, even more so because I thought going on a trip would help me feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I have been diagnosed by a PCP since 2012 with MDD, GAD. In 2016, I started seeing a male PCP in the south who told me he would handle my diagnosis unless he felt I needed to see a specialist. He changed me from Celexa to a high dose of Prozac, increased my Seroquel, put me on upto 9 Xanax a day, as well as Klonpin. Diagnosed me with ADHD, and started adderall. He changed my meds a few times saying I did not need to wean off or on as they were in the same family....I ended up in ER twice. Had several Manic breakdowns/hysterical fits (i didn't consider bipolar at the time), lost time....then over christmas, he left and the other dr refused to process my xanax refill and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawal. When he returned, he apologized and said, ""I'm surprised you're here, most people don't make it through that alive without hospitalization....I stopped going outside of needed refills. In 2018, I had no insurance and my partner and I decided I would probably be okay going off meds for a bit, and use cannabis (legal here) as the previous Dr had suggested. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is when things got bad. My symptoms blew up, and I started changing (I also turned 25). I've never been an ""angry"" person, not even when I should be. All of a sudeen I couldn't make it through work. I couldnt think. My moods were changing, and I would have a week or two, and then literally not be able to do ANYTHING for weeks. The house started getting messier, I wasn't cooking or eating, canceling shifts left and right, couldn't think or read through anything....My partner started expressing conern over my need to ""at least get back on seroquel and adderall"". In august, our dog died traumatically. PTSD symptoms fllared. My partner has BPD, anxiety, and depression that is not medicated. His anxiety sending me into full panic attacks and anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got insurance this year, and January I requested an appointment with a PCP. She immeadiately referred me to a Psychiatrist and Psychologist. First available appointment for therapy is March 25. Med appointment with Psych not available until April 9. Doctor calls and asks for urgent appointments. psych calls and says they can make an exception and get me in on April 7, I decline as 2 days isn't enough to move my off request from work. PCP has me come in to address medicine and for ""safety checks"", mentioning inpatient options. I can't do that. It is not an option. I have laid out my sypmtoms and cited that my sister and father have Bipolar disorder. My chart says ""Bipolar 2 suspected but not formally diagnosed, depression, anxiety, adhd nos.)

&amp;#x200B;

Today I went in, telling her it seems my depression has improved marginally but my anxiety has been horrible and constant. shaking constanty, not sleeping, headaches, and picking my skin on my face and arms worse than I have in a year (i skin pick with anxiety). She ups the limotrigene literally making me take more in the office, ultimate goal of upping to 200 mg in two weeks. She puts me back on Seroquel, and then tells me she would like to take me off the adderall and wished she had not started it as she attended a conference for ""patient's in crisis"" and they expressed the need to treat Bipolar or other disorders before ADHD and adderall. Says it may be part of the anxiety. I tell her I think it is a bad idea as it is the only improvement I have had to mood, ability to get out of bed, and work- and it seems to sometimes help the anxiety probably because I can think somewhat clearly. She then tells me to come in next week, and that the psych doc may completely change my meds in two weeks, and he or she may still take me off of Adderall. Hopes the seroquel will aid in sleep, picking, and anxiety, as well as upping the limotrigine. Perscribes me nothing for the panic, constant anxiety, not even refilling the 5 mg of Lorazepam she previously would give me 5-10 at a time. To be fair, I told her it wasn't doing much of anything and I did not ask for a refill today- thinking she would perscribe SOMETHING to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely overwhelmed. I have been screaming for help for months and all I have been able to get from it has been constant med changes (which I know is a thing but....), wants to take me off the only thing that is helping, and just basically having them hope I'll make it through until the med appointment, and checking weekly to see if I have killed myself or been admitted yet. The idea of going off the adderall literally crushed me. The mention of starting completely over was too much. I was literally crying and shaking the entire time I was in the appointment. I didn't ask for this. I am barely holding on. My social life is gone, I can't make any commitment by the time it comes up either from anxiety, depression, or complete exhaustion. I didn't ask for this. I can't enjoy things. I can't breathe or stop shaking. My mouth is twiching from constantly holding it in a weird position to prevent my chin from shaking. I'm falling apart and everyone see's it, but there is nothing they can do? How am I supposed to do this? Killing myself wouldn't even matter. It would make everything worse for the people already suffering from me, I'd just be another number on a statistic sheet, and other people would still go through this. I have lost 13 friends, 10 to suicide. One was a fucking psychologist.

46203,"Addictions and how the heck to quit A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions, they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted, they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle, you need help mentally, like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle, or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something ""cool"" and ""fun"" so either way you go to your addiction, your life force, what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this, you're addicted to something.

&amp;#x200B;

But like, so what? I'm just speaking out loud here, but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends, and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down, I know the answer is ""not really"", BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end, they are what make life ""okay"". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit? 

&amp;#x200B;

However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like, 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked, played League for 2 hours, THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life, as you can see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do, and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore I, like any other addict out there, don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide to quit.

1. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things? 

2. Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to ""quit"" addictions, one has to REPLACE addictions. 

3. When I am drowning in bipolar, which is often, what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell, everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place, and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore, what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse, not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?

I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100% on the things that I ""love"", being League of Legends and marijuana, and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man, why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man. ",Bipolar

49489,"Chicken or the egg? discussion! Hi everyone! 

I have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.

The question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself, so from within. Like, I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?

 This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.


For context: 
during my manic state I start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives, as if I live through their experience, I imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.
 Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. 

 
The experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already TL;DR 

Edit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through.

i’m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i’ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated.
the last maybe month or so(?) i guess i’ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i’m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i’ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it(change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations) i’m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don’t want to make it seem like i don’t care about my mental health.
i am experiencing all symptoms of (hypo?)mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you’re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it’s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn’t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don’t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.
it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there’s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don’t need to. i’m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don’t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.

45802,"Back to the psychiatrist... I sat in the parking lot outside of work today and finally made another appointment with my psychiatrist after three months of quitting medication. I'm so tired of feeling depressed and *angry* and nauseous and paranoid. I'm in a mixed episode and my method of keeping my head down and waiting it out isn't working well for me.

Music sounds strange. Voices and lights are overwhelming. Road rage spills out of me and I'm horrified but unable to stop...and when I'm not behind the wheel my feet drag, I have trouble focusing, every small task a huge ordeal. I haven't cooked in weeks -- I'm either overeating or not eating at all -- and I'm spending way too much money on delivery and drive-thru's. I'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet I know, logically, that I have no reason to feel this way.

I was on medication for six months before I stopped taking everything cold turkey. The lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when I was in a similar state last spring, but I wasn't convinced that I needed them anymore (or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate) and I was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.

It's been a whirlwind of a winter. I went through it all:

Euphoric hypomania around the holidays. Huge spending, not sleeping or eating, hanging out with everybody, falling in love, lots of drinking and partying and being merry. I could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or *be curiously spontaneous*. 

Followed by a crash. Depression. Self medicating. Waking up with a feeling of dread. Not wanting to leave the house, go to work, get out of bed. I quit my food industry job, stopped hanging out with friends, stopped replying to texts and calls.

Started feeling better for a week or two before *bam* here we are. Mixed episode.

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to be on medication or accept that I have bipolar, but I'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. I don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what I've been going through these past few months (as well as the past decade).

I took like 2.5 milligrams of Ritalin the other day that I got from a friend, after my dad berated me about not doing anything.

45588,"Medication adjustments, I'm frustrated . 22/F, Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life, I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania, anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication, it's still a struggle. 
Back in February  2017, I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area, we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him, he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first, then we would see what the next point of action would be (ADHD, depression, anxiety). Since I've been doing well with anxiety, he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. 
 Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine, clonazepam as needed (when I get aggressive, panic attacks etc). I was leveled out for months at 125mgs, but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted, family doctor wanted to keep increasing to ""see what the differance is""... I was hesitant because I'm in school, I don't want to jeopardize anything, and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said ""your feeling good now, maybe you could be feeling better"" so... benefit of the doubt, I did as I was told. 
Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in, figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate, I was feeling distracted often and easily, and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before, and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in  to see him/her for when we do and they visit. Awesome, right? 
So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to ""see the difference"" which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable, possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanic/depressive spiral right now, not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist....  FML",Bipolar

My behaviour is really confusing me though. So obviously I'm spiralling a little, feeling super anxious and emotional. I've recently had what my psych calls 'paranoia'. Fears of my house being burnt down, people dying. So I've been making sure the house is safe etc. However I've started obsessing over it more now that I'm stressed.

Got diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few weeks ago, my pcp said he didnt have the resources to properly treat so he referred me to a behavioral health center. So i've waited 5 weeks for this appointment. I was very clear while scheduling that this appointment was for seeking medication. This is the earliest appointment they could get me and it's only because they had a cancellation. Got sent the info finally today for my appointment on friday. Looked at it real quick on the portal and they've scheduled me for a telehealth session with an lpcc. I just looked it up and they cant prescribe medications. The entire fucking reason I made the appointment. 

I'm absolutely gutted. The amount of effort and energy it took me just to schedule the appointment with my pcp to get a referral (because everyone i called said i needed that) was astounding. I finally got the gumption to take hold of this shit and try to get better and this is what I get. I literally feel so defeated and like theres absolutely no point at all. I just came down from a hypo week and the depression is hitting hard and then i find this out. The rage and sadness I feel is literally making me physically ill and i feel like I could break all of my fucking fingers.

I'm sure some people really benefit from therapy and maybe at a later point in my recovery from this shit I'll be more open to it but right now all I can think is how the FUCK is talking to some stranger on the phone about my problems and them saying some stupid shit like ""oh i can hear how difficult this is for you, try these excersizes the next time you feel like you're getting unmanageable"" going to fix anything.

Despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. I’ve lost friends, like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet, you know?

46251,"Tardive Dyskinesia, medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone, 

It’s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child, and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. 

It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. 

I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first, surprisingly fine and stable, but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. 

I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. 

It’s just at my last appointment, before the mania started, we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. 

I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past, she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. 

I don’t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to don’t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. 

It’s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy, with medication, and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and it’s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. It’s scary. It’s a lot.

49837,"I think I was misdiagnosed Okay, so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and at the time I was like, ""this doesn't sound right, but I guess I'll go with it."" I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where, with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were, he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is, he never asked for specifics about what they were like, just generally if I experienced them.

The highs of my 'mania' would last about 1-3 months at a time, and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat, but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality, or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable, and my impulse control has never been great, but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. 

Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective (albeit in the middle of a depressive episode).

In fact, the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression (also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time). I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. 

Being put on meds, I was just coming out of a long funk and, after starting lamotrigene, it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things, even 2 years in, and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it, being an active parent feels like a chore, and I can't write to save my life. 

I feel like I'm a totally different person, and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed, but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist (I feel like he barely listens to me). If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them, but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there. 

I'm not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that? Should I get a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist? I just want to stop feeling this way.",Bipolar

So I've been kicking life in the butt recently and I'm doing really well at work. I'm so proud of myself and I know that I have the energy to keep going and even push bad thoughts away.

To put the situation into context, when I was first diagnosed with BPD I took a lot of time off work sick. I then decided to leave and help myself get better. I rejoined my job back in Feb and I think I surprised myself in thriving when I went back.

So I work in a call centre and if you know what its like working in one, you'll know that diseases and sickness are a minefield. On Sunday night I came down with really bad flu and took Monday off. My team leader was fine with it as they know that this is something that's going round and tbf I sounded awful on the phone. I've also decided to take today off too as I'm not feeling much better. 

I guess I'm feeling pretty guilty about it because I've never had an absence from work since I went back.

Two days ago I was told by my therapist that I could be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and recommended meds.

I never realised that I might have something like this. If anyone would be so kind and answer my very clueless questions, that would be amazing. 

My cycles of hypomania and depression are long (?) so I tend to have a few months of depression and then one or maybe two months of hypomania. When I am in my depressed state I sometimes feel for a very short time that I will switch phases into hypomania again because I feel energised, happy and productive. It only lasts for a few hours maximum and then goes back to the depression, though. More often than not it happens in the middle of the night. Is this possible that there are smaller cycles in big cycles (I hope this is understandable as I am not an English native speaker, sorry.) or could this be a sign that I actually am not bipolar?

50558,"How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not, and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.

However, I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were, retrospectively, pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very, very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly, and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.

A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts, especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.

Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes, and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that, but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.

I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma, and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed, he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.

I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway), and then fought with all my family and friends about it.

At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. 

Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though, but the level of paranoia was weird).

I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening, and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me, and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently, I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.

TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?

I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics, but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff, and I can't tell if, for me, it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

46977,"Weight gain on Seroquel So, I don't actually have Biopolar disorder, but I do have very bad depression, anxiety, and I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. As a result of all of these, my doctor prescribed me Seroquel. (Sorry if this doesn't belong here - I just noticed that a lot of questions about Seroquel are located in this sub). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard a number of stories now about how Seroquel has made people gain 15, 30, even up to 50 pounds! Everyone has said it causes them to have really bad cravings. I am already *very* self conscious about my weight, and currently sit at about 235lbs. I really do not want to gain any more (in fact, if by some rare chance I lost weight on Seroquel, that would be ideal), so I am trying to prep myself and my house before I start taking it. I plan on having my husband hide all of the snacks in our house so I cannot find them, and I'll be stocking up on veggies and fruit to eat. I'll also be taking it at night, close to bedtime, so I am hoping that will also help mitigate some of the cravings (I really don't think I'll be getting out of bed to eat...).

49952,"Wanting to be Normal It’s been a weird year. The world became a hotbed of viral death and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I mean, apparently I just couldn’t let the pandemic upstage me.

I’ve tried to deny who I am for the past 10 years. If you had to label me, I often am described as an extreme extrovert. All my friends tell me they “don’t know how I do it.” I stay out until 2am, go to bed at 3am, and wake up for work at 6am multiple days in a row without a problem. I do it all seamlessly, making it look effortless. I’ve never missed a day of work because I was tired or hungover, which is why I can’t stop acting the way I do. I don’t know how to say no. The word is literally not in my vocabulary. My lust to wander, be around friends, and experience everything the world has to offer is insatiable, but in an unhealthy way. 

I used to think that everyone else I knew was lame. I would come up with excuses for them; “they didn’t go to a party college, they’re married, they don’t like techno music.” But ultimately, I would get mad that my friends couldn’t handle social interactions the same way I did. Turns out, everyone I know is just normal and I am bipolar.

Throughout undergrad and graduate school, I normalized my actions as part of the college experience. I still did well in school while partying and sleeping around, so why worry? Promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture, so what if I was a bit extra every now and then?

Recently though, my disease has gotten the best of me. The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable, but I am plagued by insecurity, fear of missing out, irritability, anxiety, and no matter how I try to reason through them, they disrupt my life. 

There is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder, but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication. Why can’t I be the way I used to be without medication? Why can’t I feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic? I know we all need a little extra help sometime, but I am scared. I am scared to admit who I really am.",Bipolar

I have depression and anxiety (diagnosed 2 years ago, but I’ve been aware of it for much longer). I was given 3 medications for my panic attacks and depression by my college’s psychiatrist, but upon her retiring, the college wellness center notified me that a nurse practitioner would be monitoring my medication from them on. I felt unsafe, angry, and wiped from the medication so I stopped taking it. I quit going to appointments, and eventually they billed me for all of my no-shows and never followed up.

For months after I went off my meds, I experienced suicidal thoughts, extreme depressive thoughts, and began self harming. This was very out of character for me. But I stayed off my mess out of fear of regressing. I somewhat leveled out.

I have a family history of bipolar disorder, and I’m getting close to graduating. I’ve been feeling very much unlike myself lately, and I’m (and my boyfriend is) noticing rapid mood changed from manic (cleaning the ENTIRE house, instigating fights, eating constantly which I’m not sure is exactly manic but I can’t regulate it, and rapid thoughts) to depressive (laying in bed and threatening to never get out, crying before every shift at work because I’m just so tired, feeling like I’m making no progress and just feeling small). My boyfriend has told me at times he feels in-equipped talking me through these episodes. He’s expressed that I should consider going to therapy again.

I’m graduating in December, and I just feel like potentially being diagnosed with something else or being recommended new medication can ruin that. I’ve worked so hard to get here and I want my degree. But I feel as though it’s irresponsible to put off taking care of my mental health.

I’m also pretty poor so therapy would be tough for me to pay for. I do have insurance though, so I don’t know how much of a difference that could make. I’ve only ever received free therapy. 

Does anyone have recommendations? Is it worth pursuing a diagnosis for soundness of mind, or is it possible for me to just recognize that in myself and adapt?

46064,"Actually losing my mind + new meds **Trigger Warning:** Talk of suicide. Sorry I can't edit the title. 

Bipolar II here with several anxiety disorders and PPD/PPA for funzies. 

I've been actively suicidal (but not attempting) and somewhat paranoid lately. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my 10-month-old son and a volunteer project I don't want to leave unfinished. 

I should add that I am traditionally very high functioning -- successful career, marriage, healthy baby -- but life circumstances have taken a flamethrower to my world and burned it down to ashes as of late. On a scale of 1-10, my level of stress is at a 13.

I came into my psychiatrist's office sobbing Tuesday morning. I didn't tell her everything, but I told her as much as I could without her being legally obligated to commit me. My doctor doubled my Lamictal dose, added Seroquel for sleep (because I was worried about developing a physical dependency on Klonopin), and added Gabapentin as a spot treatment for anxiety. 

Last night I took the Seroquel as directed. I woke up this morning and my first thoughts upon waking were that I wanted to kill myself and that I was half hoping that my baby had died in his sleep (in some way that wasn't my fault) so that I could be free of the responsibility of being a mother. I'm sure if I walked into his room and he was actually dead, I would lose my goddamn fucking mind. It would be the literal end of me. I have really intense OCD about his safety and intense fears around him dying as a younger infant used to keep me from sleeping. So that was a super strange and disturbing mismatch of thoughts.

With that great start to the day, I quickly downed the double dose of Lamictal, as directed, and tried to get on with things. I walked back in the kitchen to my breakfast and half of it was gone and I had no recollection of eating it. I walked around the house for awhile wondering if I had put the pastry down for a minute and forgotten about it. Nope. I did not find the pastry in another room. 

Almost the exact same thing happened yesterday with a donut. I ate half of a donut on the way to the doctor's office. I thought I had a whole second donut in my bag. When I looked in my bag after the appointment, there was only half of a donut left. I thought maybe a homeless person in the grocery store ate half of it and put it back in the pastry case and I didn't notice when I purchased it (it was a sketchy grocery store; it could happen, though unlikely). I told myself that was insane and that surely I ate half of the second donut and forgot about it. I tried to tell myself I was being nuts and eat the rest of the damn donut, but I ended up spitting it out because I pictured another person's mouth on it. 

Can stress really cause memory problems like this or am I straight up losing it? Why the fuck do I keep having memory problems only around my breakfast? I am not eating very much at all, so maybe it's first thing in the morning blood sugar thing.

Around noon, with the new drugs in my system, instead of wanting to kill myself, I just don't see the point of anything. I had a job interview today that went fine. But all professional jobs just seem stupid to me all of a sudden -- like we are all working on gibberish and acting like it matters. Who the hell cares if we make a new brochure and more people buy a product? I feel like a 15-year-old who just watched Fight Club for the first time and realized capitalism is meaningless. 

I had some other projects I was working on, and I just don't understand the point now. Why would I spend time refinishing a dresser? Seriously, why? I can't think of anything more stupid.

I also had the thought this morning that I feel like I'm on life support but instead of a breathing machine, it's a bunch of pills.

Right now I'm thinking about leaving everything right where it is, telling my husband he needs to pickup the kid from daycare tonight, and just bailing and going to another country until my money runs out. That would fuck up my life and relationships irreversibly. So I might as well kill myself if I'm going that route. Or not. No idea. 

I guess I wanted to write because 

1) I would never, ever admit this stuff in real life because it makes me sound like a horrible person who hates my baby and I would never tell another living soul how bad off I really am. 

2) can Seroquel make me even more insane? Because that's how I feel. I'm thinking maybe I should just up the Lamictal and see what that does before proceeding with the onslaught of new drugs.

When I'm hypomanic I feel like can't breathe without him, the inner most part of my soul
Craves him. But when I'm depressive I don't want a bar of him.

My husband has no idea about who I really am or what I'm really like.

Anyone else been in a similar situation? 
I live in 2 different worlds.

And yes I am medicated.

49855,"Young bipolar woman hoping for future Hello everyone 

First, I'm French, so sorry if my english is not perfect perfect. 

I'm 24 years old, living in Paris and apparently bipolar type 1 with intense psychotic features. 

My life was almost totally hell for several years, after my diagnosis. 

The doctors didn't correctly adjust my medication, and I already have undergo more than 2 very big  crisis. Since we have discovered that I needed neuroleptic, my life has changed for the best. 

Despite my age, I'm still in an undergraduate program at university.  In fact, my disease has caused many issues during my school and university years. I would love to become a ""documentarian"" (somebody who work in the field of documentation, information...). I want to have my first job, in the public domain, in less than two or three years. 

I have a boyfriend since 5 years, and I would love to build a life with him. He's already working since several years, so I'm eager to work, so we can ""advance"".

I would like to have a family, one or two children, and a house, in a place that we would love. 

BUT I have to be realistic. Since my diagnosis, I had more than 2 very big crisis, and many littles ones. 

I have decided since two years to perfectly take my traitement. So my life is better now. But in 2022, I had a hypomaniac and next mixte episode, which cause many problems in my study program. I'm in the obligation to do one year in two years, because I have too much delay. 

To be precise, my doctor and I had change Zyprexa to Abilify. The Abilify was at 15mg, the lithium that I take too was too low....So there was a crisis. Now, I'm hoping that the augmentation of lithium and Abilify will be relevant and protective for the years to come. 

Moreover, I decided to establish a more protective routine. I began yoga, stopped alcool...

But I really need to be stable in the years to come in order to succeed in my academics, and in my life in general.

Do you think it is possible ? Are my dreams impossible ? Do you think my stabilization in the long run is possible ? 

I precise that recently, a doctor said me that with this treatment, it wasn't impossible to be stabilized for me, but I don't know if I can believe him.",Bipolar

Then this other guy has entered my life who i hace tons more in common with

He hasnt sent a picture yet but if i was thinking rationally he would be someone i have real longterm potential with

But the other guy is so sexually forward and hotnand i cant resist him for some reason, he is like a vampire amd l want him to drink my blood .. Not really but kind of if you get what i mean

I am somewhere with mold which means i have had insomnia for nearly a month

I should leave but i was helping a family with nine kids and they basically want my help so much and make me feel pressured so i cant go

The lawyer guy will pick me up and make me his and he is so hot and i need him so badly and i never have flings or do amythig like this but i cant control my desire help :(

The family here is not down for me to leave until end of month. And that is to go to another over protective family to see if xan sleep there.. But then they want me to come back. They sont believe me about the mold causing insomnnia but this happened to me in the past

This phone doesnt work well so sorry for all the typos

Im just so full of burning desire and i already felt this way for another stranger a few weeks ago and poof it just faded practically overnight and i cant tell what is lust and what is genuine and maybe this is all just lust but is still genuine lust and i just sont hink i can resist it

He sent me a pic of his ex wife giving him a blowjob which i thought was kind of awful since that pic was meant to be private im sure

But im probably a masochist and like how dominant and narcissistic he is in an awful primal way

46430,"A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained 

My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No, no: maybe I should get some work done. Yes work, I’ve been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent, I’m a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song, my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. 
   
First I need to make breakfast. What’s the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours; I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run, planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done, life is so fucking great. Hell, maybe I’ll even find a girlfriend soon. 

Maybe I can share this with my friends. I haven’t spoken to them in a while, but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect, that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe I’m just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I don’t deal with relationships very well. I’m either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit, in fact I haven’t yet. But I’ve learned from my mistakes.

My thoughts start racing. Maybe I’ll never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe I’m not attractive enough. Maybe I’m too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I don’t mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I won’t shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesn’t feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? I’m definitely overthinking this. This can’t be true.

 My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going, I tell him to fuck off. I can’t believe I just said that. I’m just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work, this must be the case. My friends like me, right? I need to slow down my thoughts, this is driving me mad. I order some ket, haven’t eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. 

I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. I’ve put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isn’t working as promised, in fact it’s made it worse. I’ve ignored calls from my landlord for days now, there’s no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school, I’m a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash, how can anybody enjoy music?

Oh fuck, I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he can’t make it. I’m somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I can’t tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated, I’ve had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think I’m boring, I despise being boring. 

I return home to find my books, vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. I’m never gonna use this shit, what’s the point? Ah but yes, my ket arrived, I’ll get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. 

My dad calls me when I’m all fucked up. He can tell I’m fucked up and he’s worried I’m going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that I’m sober as to not upset me more, it’s the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked, all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I’m still like this. My phone dies and I can’t get it to work, my last friend completely ghosted and in my mind gone forever. Maybe some day I’ll get better, I’m just waiting for the meds to work. I fall asleep.

I wake up, WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.

Since then I've switched to binge drinking like once a week, and it's getting out of control. I'm not taking my meds consistently, my mood is all over the place, I'm paranoid as hell and having near constant panic attacks. So I haven't had anything to drink since Sunday, and I got a prescription for naltrexone which I'm taking religiously. I absolutely hate AA and don't have other in-person options in my area, and I don't want people close to me to know how bad it's gotten again, so I feel really alone in this.

Luckily my folks helped me get off the street I sought help got the right diagnosis.  Clawed my way back into working and have held down full time work for over three and a half years.

46423,"Anyone ever done a liver cleanse? It honestly sounds like bullshit but I’ve hit a wall recently so I’m willing to expand my options a little. 

I was telling my pdoc about how I’m struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week, I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate, it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this, she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7,000 ft could have really messed things up. 

So I’m giving this a try. She ordered some “liver sauce” for me. It’s this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. 

If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead, I’d tell them to fuck off. But I’ve been with this pdoc for almost a decade now so I’m trusting her judgement. I’m still on all my meds and she told me to try and be more mindful about what I’m putting in my body. So I’m trying to avoid the temptation of fast food even tho I don’t feel like I have the energy to make healthy meals. 

I’ve only been on it for a week so I’m not expecting immediate results.

Its the second depressive episode of my life, and idk if Ill survive this one.I have abandonment trauma and each time a separation occurs, I get depressed. The more attached, the worse.My first episode happened 4 years ago and was due to leaving high school and my home town.My therapist, my family and friends helped me through. But the one who helped me the most was my boyfriend. I always thought that I would never meet a guy like those in books. And yet I did. The second we started talking I knew he was special. How odd a feeling.During three years and a half I grew better alongside him. I started loving life in its smallest forms like insect and seeds, learnt almost everything I know about nature and started caring about myself to take better care of others. If there is anything such as soulmates in this world, he is mine. Yet due to that covid nightmare and my failing at passing a specific exam, we have lived apart since March 2020, and he could not bear it. I have not been the best GF in a distance relationship since I have a strong sense of imagination which made me feel like he was with me in the new city I lived in, and the discrepancy between our dealing with distance cost us our story. Ever since our breakup 4 months ago, my life has been nothing but a nightmarish roller coaster which does not provide any fun at all. The worse in that is that I know that he will not be willing to try again for as long as I am in that state (which no one would, this is the healthy logical thing to do), and I do not know how to get out of that state without him.It is not that I need his help to get better, but rather that our being apart hurts way too much. And now that my grandad is about to die, I am seriously wondering how I will not go even more berserk and completely ruin my last chances of getting back with him. I am seeing therapists, taking meds, doing the things that I love (activism, reading, writing and drawing, playing music), seeing my friends and family and even opening up to new relationships and flirting with cute guys.

15697,"I am not shure if this is the right sub for this but i have to write this down somewhere.I am a 18 year old male avererage reddit user from Germany.About a year ago I wanted to upgrade my Pc and accidently broke it. The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last/final school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it. So i had two partys one with my mom, my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad, gradparents, brother, and my dads patchwork family. Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore.

22434,"The last time I made a real friend was in the 1st grade. I do not mean irl, either. I mean a friend as in someone I can be myself around and feel that they want to keep engaging with me. The last of my real friendships fizzled out before I was 15. I grew up sheltered from the hardships of life, but at the same time, I was stunted from growth because the only person I could learn from was an abusive alcoholic older brother. He kept me alive, but prevented me from learning how to be normal. So I retreated as far as I could, to the point where it got physical. In the last years of middle school, I stopped applying myself in school, doing nothing with my time except reading or being absent-minded. After my first year of highschool, at the age of 17, I ran away. I took a bus to my hometown and tried to reconnect with old friends. I had fun for a few months, and I learned a lot of essential things both about myself and about the real world. Then, as suddenly as it began, it ended. I had burned any bridge that could keep me where I wanted to be.I called my brother, begged forgiveness, and came back to him. He had not changed at all. It clashed violently with my newfound outlook on life, and his abuse reached an all-time high for the remainder of my 17th and 18th years on Earth. My depression came back, but I did not retreat. I fought back, mentally and physically. Eventually the abuse stopped completely. I do not know why really. But I was left in a position where my brother was my life-source, and at the same time, I did everything in my power to not engage with him.I am 23 now. I have been in the same position since then. In the handful of years past, I have tried to spark relationships with other people. Both irl and online, platonic and romantic. However, I cannot make anything work. I am fundamentally broken with no fix in sight. The only person who has expressed a want to help me is my little sister, and I cannot even bring myself to tell her what is wrong with me. I cannot fucking talk to people. I cannot look people in the eyes. I cannot feel empathy. I write this with the full expectation that it will gather no attention. I have a burn in my mind. It throbs with pain, easily dulled with distractions, but never healing. I want to feel normal. I feel like I have got a permanent burn.",Depression
13188,"I am frustrated. that is the constant theme with my life. I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity. My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted ""some job I could tolerate"" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against ""the enemy"" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives. In a sense I am back where I was before. Just waiting to die. Wanting to ""just get by"" long enough to finally be rid of it. I hate this. Just want to get out of everyone is way",Depression

9437,"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure.

I’m falling apart Never in a million years did I think I’d be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. I’ve been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late &amp; I feel like I’m just unable to get a grip on anything. 

1. My father passed away &amp; I hadn’t spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the “what if” things in relation to a better childhood.

2. I found out that my sister is not 100% my sister &amp; we don’t have the same father &amp; we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also don’t have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now it’s a waiting game. I live in the same house as her &amp; have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.

3. The girl I have been in a situation-ship doesn’t feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much, honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends &amp; love one another. I never thought I’d catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship , the sex is great &amp; we have so many great laughs &amp; moments. She’s been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesn’t feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart &amp; don’t know how to navigate it. I don’t want to just get rid of her as a friend, I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but I’m not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. 

Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother &amp; I feel like I’m suffocating. My appetite is shot, I feel restless where I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I’ve been having very dark thoughts &amp; find humor in self harm jokes to myself &amp; my close friends. 

Maybe this is a cry for help, maybe I’m trying. I’m not sure. But if anyone reads this &amp; has advice or a heart to be here for me I would love &amp; cherish your kindness. Thank you .",Depression

15514,2 years of depersonalization/derealisation and depression and suicidal thoughts. It has not gotten better and I now hate myself and I know I will not ever like myself again. I have become a robot. I cannot even talk or look any family members in the eyes. Friends do not understand the dpdr side. It hurts because I have only opened up to two people about it who are my friends and one said he thought he had it and it was not that bad and the other asked if I am imagining it all this going on and I have to decide my future now. I am going into college in a month and have to pick a job and all. Antidepressants not working and I have gotten fat and cannot even care. Only reason I live is because if I did not it would because my family pain and I am very grateful that my family loves me even though most of them do not love eachother but I do not even deserve their love. I hate myself for past mistakes and believe I do not ever deserve love or happiness but sometimes think death is an easy way out and think maybe living and suffering would be a better punishment for me. Idk life is so hard I just slept most of the day today. I have not even had the energy to socialize anymore. I never really had it but I forced myself to but now I cannot even do that. I think old friends think I am Just being rude and do not like them but its not even true. No one even takes me seriously anyway I am just a joke of the group who they think is so stupid because I just laugh and nod if it gets to awkward and can never say what I actually want to.

27296,I am trying to make a checklist of things to do to avoid the deepest pits of depression - or at least mitigate the damage done when in that hole. Just a list of things to maintain or have someone else help me (or you) maintain to reduce the impact of those times - if they cannot be avoided entirely. Thought some of you might have some ideas I have not thought of. So far I have: 1. Are you gaming too much? (I tend to use games to avoid my problems)2. Have you been drinking enough water? 3. Do you need a haircut? (When my hair gets long I tend to let go of all my other grooming which just makes everything worse)4. Have you done the laundry?5. Is there plenty of food in the house? (If I do not have easily accessible food in bad times I either will not eat or will eat terribly unhealthy food)it is a start.

7793,"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)",Depression
18211,"It has been a few years since she broke up with me. And I love my new girlfriend, but it is a very different kind of love. Our relationship was short, not very deep, but the memories I had from it are perceived as the best memories I had in life. When I think about it, all pictures look so bright and colorful in my head, all accompanied with a feeling of pure joy. Every single moment I remember of is good with the exception of the day she broke up and the days following it. Sex was also incredible, even though I had several partners after her I was still unable to feel as good. I feel like this feeling is in the back of my head for a few years and dragging me down, overall decreasing my well-being.Can anyone give me advice that actual works, and not those that in theory should work? Any first hand experience with fixing this in your life? If I feel like this does it mean I should leave my current girlfriend? What if I want to commit with her for the long run, is it not ideal?

Originally, I was waiting to hear about scheduling. Then I learned that no counselors could handle my schedule(I work till 7pm mon-Fri). So my supervisor said make it work, no matter what. I opened my schedule, but I think I am not going to hear anything back from them.I just need some way to cope with all these emotions. I want to be able to cope, and I used to think I could, but now that I am getting hit from every direction, I realize all I can do to handle it is break down and hurt myself. I promised I would not do it again, and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube, I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games, but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk, I will end up punching a wall, and will make my work life harder, since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry, but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off, because I am porn free now, and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here, numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit, not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack, but I am afraid if I use it to cope once, I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad, lonely drunk, and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now, I cannot even talk to my friends about this, because there is secrets(not mine) they cannot know.

My sleep schedule has gotten a lot better, I started eating and drinking water regularly in 2 weeks after I started taking my meds. that is a big step forward (obviously) but I have absolutely no energy and fail to do the simplest tasks around the house, I cannot leave my bed and force myself to even go get groceries.

Social withdrawal used to give me enough emotional strength to bounce back into life, now it only makes things worse.

26015,"The older I get all I can do is laugh at the sheer absurdity of life. I wake up, eat breakfast, work a soul crushing job for 10-12 hours, go home, eat dinner, shower, sleep, and do it all over again. I am supposed to be grateful for what I have, but I am not. I hate nearly every detail of my life. I want to make changes, but that seems like an insurmountable task. I have shut myself off from everyone except for my SO, but I have been keeping them at arms length too. I will not let anyone get close enough to see just how knackered I am by life. The numbness I feel is only topped by the bitterness that caused it. When my fractured mental state is on the verge of collapse I just start laughing uncontrollably. I see now that none of it matters, I am just another grunt trying to make enough money to survive. If anything happens to me, only a few will be affected. I have suicidal thoughts, not tendencies, at least not yet. I think of death almost non-stop. I welcome the idea of dying almost every waking moment, try to keep myself distracted from it, not always successful. I honestly think I died 10 years ago and have been stuck in limbo, would certainly explain the absurdity of the last 10 or so years. But if that is not true then I must be insane or delusional at the very least. I go down that rabbit hole on a near daily basis. I am not even sure I want life to be real anymore. Maybe I am just trapped in someone is imagination or vivid dreams. What is real life, how do I return to it, or do I stay trapped in this cycle of trying to break free of some self imposed prison for mistakes I made years ago. I cannot always distinguish fact from fiction, but I also feel like I am just punishing myself. Pushing my mental state further and further down into the abyss.

13979,"I am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a ""she will"" is the best way I can describe this feeling. I remember May of 2018 when I graduated from college. That was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. I was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. I felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life: starting a new job, making my own money, having my own true apartment. At that time I felt pretty happy.In January of this year I had been offered a new job (after searching for 18 months). I had received a 40% salary increase, had the opportunity to move to Atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. One would argue that this was a serious milestone I achieved after graduating from college. should not I be elated about this opportunity? I have been in the new job for 5 months, the new city for 3 months. As I am typing this post out, I am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself, ""How do I truly feel about this incredible milestone?"" that is just it, I do not feel anything. All I truly feel towards this is ""it is a milestone, and it happened."" Its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. I would hate to use the word ""dull"" but that is really what it feels like. The outward emotion that this entire milestone feels, just ""dull"". And yet in reality ""dull"" is not at all how I should be describing this insane achievement. Honestly, its hard to explain.Side note: I have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed I was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me ""Is everything going OK in your world? Atlanta still treating you OK? Just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. Let me know if you need anything."" Him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and ""a she will"" is how I would describe it. And honestly I have felt this way for the past year almost, even at my old job. I have no one to talk to deeply about these feelings so I wanted to share here.

During these episodes, he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. 

Here is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. 

A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. 

They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet, the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.

I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. 

I am terrified of my father, and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me, but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also, he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet, my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen, which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.

I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me, knew about the abuse, and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. 

I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.

I'd lose everything, become homeless, my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks. My therapist also stated that I should be ""proud"" that I havnt killed myself, since most others would have with what Ive been through. This is after she knew I had slit my throat at 18. 

I can't stop crying.",Depression
8014,"I wish I had died last year.I could not create anything today. I could barely sing. I feel like when quarantine began, I was meant to kill myself. Oh my God, I actually *regret* not killing myself last year.I exercised a little, showered, sight-read piano music for literally 10 minutes, sang for about 30 seconds until I hated my voice, and cuddled with my cat. Right when I started singing, I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great, when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything.

23814,"This is not a cry for help or a pity party post, but I am looking for input on whoever reads the post and has any insight on ECT or TMS therapy...I am not doing well mentally. I have not been for a long, long time. With MDD (Unipolar) among other things such as GAD and PTSD, the low cycles come in waves, but the highs are always mild and do not always seem to last all that long.I have been told countless times that I am such a negative person, I complain a lot, or I never seem like I am having fun. I get blamed for a mental health disorder that I have been battling for years and have tried countless medications, therapists, psychiatrists, holistic supplements, meditation, testosterone therapy, to name the healthy and positive actions I have taken. I have also been dependent on alcohol and drugs, used sex and intimacy as a means of feeling better about myself, self-harm, attempted suicide for the negatives...Truth is, I really want to live and be happy and enjoy my life, but sometimes, especially lately, every day seems like an uphill battle, every day I have to fight myself just to get out of bed in the morning and go to work (and I have a good job and am doing well financially), every day, I worry that my mental illness is pushing people away in my life (fact: it has), every day I worry that I am ruining my relationship because of my inability to manage my emotions and mental health issues. I want so desperately to not feel like this anymore and I am running out of options that I have not already tried.I started looking into ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) treatment as a last resort for treating my mental health issues and I was nervous about the risks associated (such as retrograde amnesia). I do not want to risk zapping away memories in my brain and losing part of who I am, but had decided to start looking into it as all else has failed so far. I was very fortunate to find that there is a safer alternative that is only available medically here in Austin. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a safer alternative to ECT with less side effects and is less intrusive.I was worried about ECT because these treatments are a multi-week long process and ECT makes you lose short term memory temporarily and you need someone to pick you up and drop you off from the clinic, and it would have meant I would be unlikely able to work during the process. TMS does not have this same effect and I would be able to do it more independently and still be able to work.If I am being honest, I am still nervous about all of it. I have my first TMS consultation this afternoon. I want my brain to be healthy again, I want to be able to enjoy my life. I am so blessed to have the people in my life that I do, but I am just as frustrated at my lack of progress as anybody else who knows me and has had to deal with me. It certainly sucks so fucking much to always be told that I am not doing enough, that I create my own situation. If I have learned anything throughout all of this is that I do not have control over my emotions, I do not have control over my well-being, I do not have control over my life. But I want to. And I am getting to that point where maybe I do need it all zapped away and start afresh.

11913,"I just found this community and I am just curious as to how does depression feel. Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them, my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything. I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed, I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding me.But sometimes out of nowhere, without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely, like no one cares about me, deep down I know that is not true, but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then. I am an overthinker, and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life, this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff, I am feeling a lot better. But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes, as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here. it is weird, I just feel like no one would understand, idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts. But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love, that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me, that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side, realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid, but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly, but idk if that is just making me close off, make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels... So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am, i am not insecure of myself either, I am happy with everyone that is with me right now, well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good, my family, my bf and the few friends I trust.

I need your guidance for what to do with my life. 
I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss waking up excited. I miss caring. I miss eating with people. I miss being motivated. I miss having a purpose. I miss having a goal.

17357,"I was bullied like almost everyone else and ever since life was different. I always thought there was a pre-defined mindset that I had to get myself to believe in to be happy (like ''I do not care what others think etc.). But that is bullshit, affirmations do not work and they will never work, because they do not change anything in your life.Everything somebody else can do for you is give you an explanation on why your brain is the way it is. There are no supplements, Affirmations, meditations, drugs, Therapies that will make a significant change.If you do not physically change something in your life everything will stay the same.Being bullied left me in an unconsciouss shame state that followed me everywhere. what is the easiest and most reliable way to live with Trauma? Coping strategies. My coping strategies were Videogames and social media.The bad thing in your life are not the circumstances, its how you react to them. Lock them up, cope them away with addictions, perform compulsions, evade them at any cost will never ever change something.Be clever and start recognising what your coping strategies are and just do not commit to them anymore. No affirmations necessary, your brain will sort things through by itself.Coping strategies are basically everything that make you feel good immediately (your smartphone, food, drugs...). If you do not try to stop your coping then you are not allowed to ask for help in my eyes because you should know what to do.How can you heal in circumstances that made you that way?You will notice that your life might get very silent, even lonely. But that is just the demons you locked away. You will learn to regulate your emotions again. Shame is the Key emotion why mental illness is so prevalent nowadays. This is how the sequence usually goes:Trauma-&gt;Shame-&gt;coping strategies-&gt;addictions-&gt;depression, ocd, anxiety, borderline, extreme narcissm... What your mental illness will be in the end depends on the person, some might get ocd and do compulsive information seeking, some might become grandiose narcissists and completely ignore their problem and just make it their daily life to get affirmation from others on social media.that is the thing about self esteem: It does not need a reason.Narcissism always needs a reason, mostly multiple times a day a. What does your brain need its emotional regulation for if you perform instant reward coping strategies instead? If you are as desperate as I was, you should take my advice seriously. It will not be enjoyable but that is what life is like.What if instant rewards would have been accessible in ancient times? The people would not have evolved and would probably have died because nobody wants to work for long term goals if there are instant rewards. Everyone is responsible for their own mental health.Get off the internet, use it only for important things. Buy an old Phone without internet. Move out of your parents house if you have not already.

Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then ""we"" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here.

26129,"During high school I would cry pretty much every single day when I got back home. I was going through horrible low moods, my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and I would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. I had no drive or motivation for anything, but I just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. At the time I did not really realise I was depressed, I thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. I knew I was exhibiting symptoms of depression but I never really thought this is depression and I am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally, and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.I then got into University and hoped for a fresh start. I had a decent time there and socially had no problems, but I myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. This significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout University, I never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because I would have to study throughout the holidays. Whilst I had multiple break downs throughout, I do not think it was as bad as during school.Done with University and back with my family, because I wanted to take a small break from everything. I used to have a lot of problems with my parents, particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. Again, almost like at school, I would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. Went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately, I believe I have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. We most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. At that time, I realised that I have been pretty much depressed since high school, driven by my relationship with my parents. I still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes, but we r both working to being better with each other. I got back to University but still am with my family. With the pandemic, I am stuck at home most of the time. I am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where I am completely alone. However, being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year, the stress has been continuously building up. My parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as I have pretty much since I was a kid, I would support them a lot during these times. This also subtly contributed to my stress. I had not managed to have an actual break, (though I do have long periods of stress induced procrastination) and eventually I messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down, like the ones I had during the worst of my times back during my old University or school years. I felt like this time, I ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression, and really felt like they could kill me. For what has been pretty much a decade of depression, bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress, I have experienced physical symptoms like pain. But right now, I feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over (or it already has). I am repeating the same cycle of procrastination, self hate, not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed, even though I really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercise/go out for walks. I really do not need to socialise with people and I do maintain decent contact with my friends. I feel depressed pretty much 24/7 when I am not distracting myself with music, media entertainment, socialising. I cannot focus on my studies at all and I am just so tired. I have been tired for a decade and I just do not know what to do anymore. I always tell myself that one day it just will not be like this, but I am exhausted, drained and no matter how much I rest I just feel horrible. I do not know what to do anymore.

But I believe I have been depressed for a very long time (however its never been diagnosed.) sometimes I feel like I am almost just overreacting or like my depression is not really there, and it does not help that its never been officially diagnosed.Sometimes I have days where it feels like depression takes over, then the next day will be really good and Ill feel dumb for how I felt the day before. Almost like imposter syndrome but opposite. Does anyone else feel this way? Or any thoughts? I feel like my depression is fake sometimes",Depression
24086,"I have had what is likely depression for about 3 years now. I do not know why it came about, and I do not understand why its going away. But its wrong, and I do not want to get better.I am so used to the familiarity of it. There was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numb-emptiness, or just plain heaviness. I had my low times, I self-harmed, and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill, the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. It was reliable. It was known. It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now, I have been, by most views, improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the self-harm is fading, and as it does, the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet, I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point, and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because, there is no closure, nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this. I am not really sure how much you all will know of this, but its worth a shot. Thank you in advance. I am getting better, and I hate it.",Depression
13455,"Hello friends,I have struggled with depression for years. I have been on Lexapro for \~2 years. It...helped. Sort of. Still felt worthless, tired, sad, irritable, suicidal, etc., but maybe it took the edge off. However, I did have some sexual side effects (hard to finish, hard to stay up).Fast forward to this year, and I got a better doctor who decided to add Wellbutrin. After about a month, it is like switch flipped. I still have problems, but they do not seem insurmountable. Especially to how I have felt in the past, it is a nice change.Now, my question is - should I start weening off Lexapro? Not sure it did a ton, and the side effects were...not ideal. But I am not sure if the two meds are working together. Just wanted to get some thoughts so I do not backslide.Thanks! Medication opinions - Lexapro and Wellbutrin",Depression

Im tired of crying myself to sleep and having no one to talk to about this. They see me happy one day and the following they try list all my triggers. 

I feel like the only reason i havnt killed myself is because of my sister. Shes the only one that understands why i take the pills. Shes the only one who asks how im going on a specific day. But again she is a child so i know i cannot burden her with these thoughts. And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.

Everytime they bring up the pills it makes me feel even more useless than i already feel. Everytime I have to remind someone how to love me i somehoe loose the love i have for myself. I see you trying but its just not enough. When does the pain of it all end. Will i ever be happy in this life? Or should i just give up whiles its still early?",Depression

16518,"Self-Fulfilling Prophesy: *The sociopsychological phenomenon of someone ""predicting"" or expecting something, and this ""prediction"" or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief.*I have a lot of anxiety about the upcoming immigration to from Russia to Israel, where my parents live now, and I have been feeling afraid that I would be denied entry after I have done all the work they asked. I have been chatting about it with my gaming friends for a while, which would calm the nerves a bit. But I have been feeling angry at my gaming friends today. We used to be tight when I was in the you.S. being in the same time zone made it easier to play games together than it does now. Our little group helped us get through the pandemic, as we would get online every night and play PUBG, Apex, Destiny, and many other games we tried over the year. And our little group grew - first it was just the three of us, now it is seven. We also knew most of each other IRL, so we would hang out at a bar or play D&amp;D together.When I moved back to Russia in April, I used to ask them every day if they will be on, because I have got no other socializing going on for me except for family. Every day I would wake up at 7 AM on my time just to speak with my friends. I would spend a couple of hours with them, before they would peel off to sleep, and then spend the rest of the day anxious about immigration.But as the time went on, I started to get less and less responses. I would ask in our chat if people were planning to be online in the evening while it was still morning over there, just to make sure that everyone got to reply. Also, so I would get ample time to see their answers, to know when I should wake up. Initially I would get many confirmations, then less and less, then people stopped answering consistently. Eventually I would feel lucky if I got so much as a no. The distance separated us. Over time they have become busier with jobs picking up after COVID mandates lifted, with new partners, just life. I however, regressed: I am alone (or more accurately, feeling alone), I got no job, I separated with a girlfriend of 7 years, because the distance and the uncertainty of whether I am coming back to America and when, made our relationship impossible. Chronic depression became more consistent. I started to realize that I was angry at them for moving on, for finding people closer to them to spend time around, for hanging out together without me. I started blaming myself for feeling angry and upset that I was not getting the socializing I needed. I have had my depressive episodes and they have offered support over chat, which was a nice gesture. But I realized that I was angry because they said, They were there for me, except the times when I needed them. I cannot blame them for not noticing that me asking if people are online in the evening is a cry for help. That I am desperate for human contact other than my family members that I am forced to live with because I have nothing else in Russia. That I feel alone in a crowded room.I feel lonely. I feel unwanted. I feel unattractive. I feel like I am nobody. I feel like I have got nothing to offer. I feel let down because I have let myself down.I had a dream about living in the you.S. till the day I die.I LOVED living in the you.S.I feel like I have let myself down because I had not fought harder for my right to be there. Because I have not explored more options for stay. Because I did not participate in the Green Card lottery consistently. Because I did not save money to go to Grad School. Because I did not confront the Executive Director of the facility I worked at as a Counselor when he denied my request for a work visa, which they did sponsor for past employees.During these 8 years I have learned the language almost to perfection, I got a college degree, I have worked, I have got a B.A. in Psychology, I worked again, I asked, politely to let me work longer. I did everything right. And it was still not enough.In my academic life I have felt like I was barely passing, that I was procrastinating and not doing enough. I feel like I do not deserve both of my degrees. In my work life I feel that I was lucky I got my job and that I did not deserve it. That I was not doing more than I possibly could, even though some days I would work for 15 hours straight during a pandemic, ears red from the facemask loops, then falling into my bed half-dead, after driving home for an hour, so that I could be up in another two to do it all over again.And still I feel let down because I believe I let myself get kicked out of the you.S.And now I sit in the apartment in Russia, struggling to send out the paperwork for the Israeli immigration, because I am afraid, I am going to fail at that too. I choose not to act because I do not want to disappoint myself again. And it will come true, because knowing all of this is not enough motivation for me to do something about it.So, all I got left is the feeling of anger at the people who cannot play with me no more.

I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help. About my life goals, I do have a serious passion for Physics and Astronomy. But I end up spending most of my time playing video games.

17701,"I was a depressive alcoholic for the last couple of years, though I was still able to function and work and be responsible enough to get by, when I told my family I was a drunk(East Indian background and traditional) they hoped me well and said they love me but they did not want to associate with me until I got my depression and alcoholism and life in general order because they are embarrassed what my relatives would think if they found out about my issues.They stopped talking to me, my siblings stopped talking to me as well when they found out I was an alcoholic.

However I noticed I still do not trust any of these people, because I always remember deep down when I needed help the most and someone to just talk to, the only help I got was myself, so I am jaded because I do not trust people to be there for me anymore, not when I really need them.

24361,"I luckily rarely feel bad depression, tonight is one of those times. This post is just to write it out of myself.I feel like I am in a battle with my own thoughts and emotions. Right now I feel alone even though I have people who support me. I do not want to give in to depression, but I also do not have life goals, motivation or really anything that excites me. I do not have a bad life, but I do not have anything going on now (no job, no healthy hobbies, no meeting with people). I was not fully okay when I still attended school either which makes me worried/scared that this feeling will come back even when I will finally have a job that occupies my mind.I am stressed about having to juggle and fix so many things in my life at once: work, friendships, house chores, anxiety, depression, hobbies, habits, therapist... it is too much, and it feels like I am going nowhere. It feels like that even though I try to be better, get better, it works only for some time then all comes crashing down. As if it was a sign that my efforts are worthless.I really want this war in my head to end. Even though anxiety and depression have been giving me a hell of a time in these past months, somehow I still have hope left. Somehow I still do not want to give up.

I do not want to hear you deny the bad things I said about myself and list out what YOU think are good things about me, because you really do not know a damn thing about me. All I want to hear from you is that you heard me, and that it is OKAY for me to die. Alright, maybe the second part is a bit tough. I am pretty sure it is against the rule, and nobody is going to be crazy enough to say that to a suicidal person. It certainly not going to help them get better. However, that is honestly how I feel. I just want someone to tell me it is okay for me to escape this hellhole, instead of continuing to endure this suffering. I just cannot do it anymore.Now, what about you all? I want to know what you want to hear from people. Maybe, this will help lessen those generic anti-suicide responds. I know people are tired of hearing it, myself included. I also would like to thank people who try to help others. I know it is tough, since you do not know what the right things to say. Sometime, there is just no right things to say. And that is okay.

47482,"I really dont know what to do anymore For the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this. I have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past 6 years and gradually getting worse. I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. Realistically I don't think my prognosis is too good. But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now",Depression

I tend to my son every needs, I play, I read, I take him on walks and when he goes to bed around 7/8 I go to bed too, and I am asleep by 10.I am currently on sick leave due to PTSD, I stayed home with my son till march, and now I have 6 hours all alone every day except the weekends. I just spend my days,relaxing, napping some days, cleaning and getting back up on my feet. I went through PND/PNA and PPD/PPA (pregnancy/postpartum anxiety+depression), my PTSD went to shits and my eating disorder blossomed again. So its been hard, and since I NEED to put my son first that is what I have done, and now I have the time to put myself first during the daytime. And for me its working.I got no social life, well I talk a bit to the neighbours and parents in kindergarten, but I do not meet up with my friends. I do not date, I just focus on me and my son, and I do not feel lonely or anything just as a bit of a failure at times. Its hard being a mom on my worst days, I do not want to get up from bed but I have to, getting outside to the playground is also hard but I do it.I feel like I am putting in so much hard work, but when my mom talks down on me tells me to cut the crap and my life is miserable, I am starting to think that it might be.From I was 8 and up until now everything has been utter shit, but I am contempt, I am in a good place even though I am struggeling. My PPD has lifted alot and I love my son so so much, and I have been waiting for the whole motherly feeling and now that its here I just want to stay in this bubble. I am working hard to be the mama my son needs, and that means I do not do much social and during the day.

(and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon.

21690,"I moved to Utah about a year and a half ago. We went outside of the polluted city for the first time during the pandemic. We stayed for so long that it was pitch-black on the drive home. I looked out the car window and was able to see the entire milkyway, millions of stars and the bluish purple hues. I was so overwhelmed because it was my first time seeing so many stars. I felt like I was going to fall in to the sky. All I could think about since that was that I wanted to go out in the wild again and lay down and watch the stars all night. During some very tough days this past year, my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do, he was ready to take me anywhere and make it happen just to see me happy again. I asked him to take me to see the stars again. Its so fucking cliche, I am so sorry but that is just what I really wanted. So he promised me. We never actually went. Whenever it comes up, its always either too expensive, too dangerous, I am not trying hard enough to plan it, hes not super interested in seeing it anyway etc. We have been wanting to go somewhere but everything is too expensive and not worth it. Yet he goes out drinking every weekend and ends up spending hundreds of dollars and gets trashed.Yesterday he was on the phone with one of his friends and his friend mentioned going to a popular camping spot (also popular star gazing spot) and within minutes they planned a trip to go the next day. I was in the room and could hear the entire conversation. They went out drinking to discuss the plans and I was not invited or even looked at in the face. I left his apartment and went home. I feel so betrayed and lonely. Am I overreacting? Maybe, but considering it was literally the only thing my depressed ass wanted to do, I think its okay to feel extremely upset and want to break up with him because I literally have no worth to him. I am not good enough to camping with for 1 night, not even good enough to be invited to the one thing I wanted to do. And if its another event I am always invited last minute and never have time to get ready and he complains that hes sick of explaining why I do not show up at events. I feel like hes just setting me up for failure and complaining to me about it. I had only one thing I was actually looking forward to this entire year and my boyfriend betrayed me",Depression

I just signed up for Reddit not long ago and it makes me feel welcome and safe. that is when I started searching for this sub.I had no idea that there were two people most of the time that recognized your problems: the empath and the sympath. I 100% believe I am an empathetic person. When I tell people that I understand what they feel, I can literally feel it. I make other peoples problems my problems. I decide Okay this person is clearly over barren with their difficulties that if maybe I just take a little weight off of their shoulders, they could breathe. After all, I would want someone to do that for me.People can never really reciprocate the feelings correctly. I know that sounds odd. There are no wrong ways to feel, but something about the demeanor of those i help really tears me down. I am slowly giving, giving, giving until I am all out.I can tell that recently my depression is worsening. I cannot tell if it is a hormonal wave, but it is so extreme. I have not showered in like two and a half days. But its been longer before. I am trying to find my footing, but I can feel myself mentally drift.

Everyone I have ever met loves my mom. The only people who really know what is going on is my boyfriend and my dad. We label her as narcissistic because I did not recognize she was so mean because I was so used to it. Today, I was crying for many reasons. First it was because my anxiety was bad and I did not really have anyone to talk to. Then, it was because I felt guilty that I accidentally kept my exs pictures in the My Eyes Only section of snapchat (my boyfriend did not care as long as I deleted them). I think I might be bipolar. I feel like I am blowing things out of proportion when I say that, but I might need to be reevaluated. By a psychologist, not a therapist that will befriend my mom and become BFFS WITH. I played myself and lied to her the entire time I was her client. I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was taking lexapro, but stopped because I started taking a whole 20 mg pill that was supposed to be cut in half. My dumbass. But when I took it consistently 3 weeks in a row in rehab, I hated how it trapped me in my own brain. This post was very hard to make and I do not think I can retype it if it gets taken down bc its unfocused. I am so sorry. I do not care if you leave advice or not for me, as long as you read my post. All I wanted was to be heard because I could not express my true self. If you need more context, please just ask. I am sorry, again for my ADD rambling. I know there are some major things I am leaving out. I am such a fucking crybaby.",Depression

48119,"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post, but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?

Update: After writing this, briefly texting with a redditor, who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit (aka crying), I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there, but I also went to bed on time, to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So, up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track  managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative.

Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either.

Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her.

The hardest part for me right now is I don't have any reason to be unhappy, nothing I can really point to and say this is making me feel like crap, and that makes me like a bratty little B crying and complaining

There's nothing really to talk to others about because again, there's nothing that I'd even remotely describe as saddening or upsetting.

7067,"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

last night around 2 am, she passed. my sweet lilith. i had her for a good 7 years and she was a darling, so sweet and kind, jumpy and squeaky, all up until the last couple days where she suddenly became so tired. her last day came around and i just *felt* it. she was so exhausted. i tried to get her into my local vet yesterday but they said they didnt have time for her that day? so we stuck it out, hoping i would get her in today, but. there wasnt time. i gave her as much water as she would take before she passed, tried to feed her, and mostly just. talked to her and praised her and loved her. i held her all night. she hadnt eaten in a day already, aside from the very few nibbles she'd taken from what i tried to give her. tomato was her favorite food, so i brought her some tomato last night as she was on her last leg. it was her last treat. i was surprised she came running for it, despite her exhaustion, and she had a little nibble. just a little. i wanted her to have more, but she was so tired and im glad she had even that. everything seemed so much for her. she snuggled with me in some of her last moments before i tucked her back in her cage where she felt safest. and she passed.    
i have friends, but not very close ones anymore, as ive isolated myself so much. i feel very, very alone, and i dont know if there's anything else for me here. i think there's probably not. im so, so tired and im ready to give up. my parents are going away for the weekend and, with the way things are lining up, i wonder if now is the time.   
i guess im just posting this to vent, or maybe to have someone for a little bit, or maybe a call for help, or something. i dont know. but im so tired and sad and afraid and alone and im so over it all. i want it to end so badly and. idk. im sorry, i really am, i just want it all to end. i want it to be over so badly.",Personality disorder

50887,"Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked, and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.

The funny thing is, I am continually, day after day, in my attempts not to appear this way, am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others, mere glances, I hide myself away in plain sight with poor, meek body language, I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.

All in vain attempts of appearing, in my delusional mind, 'nice'. It is so self destructive, you essentially let people walk over you, ignore you, in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you, will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours, or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. 

Let me give an example, of what I'm thinking. 

You're shopping for groceries, you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else, you need something on that shelf, like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god, don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me, what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.
So, instead, why not stand in their shadow, and wait patiently, let your presence be seen, in an ideal world, ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes, stand next to them, and don't budge, just let them know non verbally, you're waiting.

Another example, you're at the cashier, they're doing your items, I always look everywhere but where I need to look, I lose focus on what I should be looking at, which is the items I'm paying for, the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something, small talk for instance, well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk, so why not just give closed answers, why do I feel the need to fill the silences, to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered, shy, unconfident, I see it in their faces, they see the fear, they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face, then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. 
So why not stay calmer, speak slower, not try and have a positive small talk experience, just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed, ashamed, and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.

I'm rambling a bit, losing focus on my words, sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more, being true to yourself, being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.

50724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem?

50948,"must bargain with the universe for social plans so my (18ftm) coworker ""evilyn"" (19f) was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away, she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride, i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. 

she mentioned having extra tickets, but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me, and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15$ each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like ""so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets?"" it's not unreasonable i know- if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100% platonic because we're coworkers and i *think* she knows i'm gay (the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls). but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. 

another fear: evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with ""jonah"" (20M) our other coworker, a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued (lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake, let's not.) as in, they've hung out outside of work more than once. now, i don't think jonah is the petty type, but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something (idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment) that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. 

rambling post, but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone.

I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives, overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.

The average person is socially active, whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans, messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new, even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch-22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.

51030,"I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.

I (M,50) was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30+ years ago. 

I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly: ""oh hey, that's a familiar face... :-)"". 

I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk, she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. 

We exchanged some small talk... what do you do, where do you live, do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. 

I already was kind of nervous, because of the small talk situation, but when the topic of the other people from the past came up, i began to panic. 

The thing is, that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her, she was always nice.

But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.

So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. 

There were just so many thoughts in my head, but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.

A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.

But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good idea:

""when i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to call/text anytime, i don't like this.""

""i clearly still have a problem with the ""old times"" and the people from the past.""

""when i call/text with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.""

""this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years, so i can't explain this, and don't think that i can lie, either...""

""besides, if i exchange numbers then i will have to, well, talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person, and since i live very isolated, i kind of forgot how to do this.""

""and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others..."" 

""it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.""

""but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers, who does something like this? i would have to explain this.""

I was spiraling...

I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.

Then she said: ""you don't have to say anything"".

I think I mumbled something like ""okay"", and ""it was really nice meeting you"" and we parted.

I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.

I really would have liked to be able to do this, but i couldn't.

I regret this now, and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her (I know her address but of course not her phone number, so i would have to write a letter i guess) and try to explain things.

At least tell her that it \*really\* was nice seeing her and that my reaction (or lack thereof), was not because of her, but had other personal reasons.

50732,"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed.

There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to, so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women, and they’re all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions, I wasn’t prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didn’t wear anything currently, then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. 

I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person, because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didn’t really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it, the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. 

I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.

Hi everyone!

Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay, but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards, shorter answers, not really engaging in text chats.  
It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her.  
Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice.  
Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking.  
She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it, therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank.  
Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman (I still think she is though), but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities.  
So, I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee.  
She texted me back, that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me, but her life is too ""full"" right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry, that's probably not the answer I was hoping for, but she is just trying to being honest.  
I wrote back, that it wasn't the answer I hoped for, but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome, so I had to write her.  
  
So, that's it. I'm a bit sad now, although I knew this would be  coming. Still it's better to be in the clear.  
  
I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated, live through the frustration and get out of it on top.

My GF just built a new computer, its her first one, she is very excited to do some vtubing on twitch or whereever. She's so happy about it... everytime I hear her being excited about it, it hurts so hard. When Im alone it even makes me cry (rare cuz im usually way over crying, depression level wise). Also anything else she is happy about, like a new plushie, or whatever she cooked, its always so innocent that it just hurts. (inb4 ppl doubt my AvPD cuz i have GF: I ghost her for about 4 out of 7 weekdays, for no reason at all, cant do anything against it... Yet she stays, idk why.)

The dog greeting my parents. Animals in general.. 

My grandpa being happy about anything even tho he old.

I just want their lifes, I guess? I cannot be happy and I only think about negative stuff all fkin day. But im  stuck in my own world, my own body, so I sleep more than 50% of the day. That way I only feel like shit 50% of the day. 5head move, I know.

51830,"Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently I’ve been having a hard time, and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life, I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. 

Lately I’ve begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing, no trace. Not suicide. I’m not suicidal at all, I mean leaving, going somewhere I’m not known, changing all my details, and completely starting over. I can’t help but feel it would make no difference to anyone, in fact it might even be better.

I’ve googled step by step ‘how to’s ’ on it.

I’m hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through - or any advice.

Because this is mostly just a fantasy, but the idea is sticking in my head more than I’d like it to. I don’t actually want to go through with it. I think …

50931,"Root of avpd and life-damaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak, defenseless, I feel like prey living among predators.
My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased, it ""just"" requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.

I was bullied by two different group of people, I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness, the second time I was bullied by my friends (at that time), initially they even respected me cause I was serious, but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective, you just need to be more tough and confident (without any reason).

This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recently:
when I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance, know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it, cause how they being so stupid could think about it really, it's not possible, but they fuck, I don't.

second was about clothes, hypebeasts.
I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird, lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes, I just couldn't understand their reaction.

Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed, or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.

I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not, it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.

It seems like a lot of her advice boils down to ""just do it,"" which isn't always a negative, but I'm not looking for simple actions to take, which is important, but CBT can be extremely disappointing. I'm interested in delving deep into my psyche, but she doesn't seem as curious as I'd prefer. She doesn't ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns, with general roots behind them. She talks specifically about surface problems, but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life. I know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences, but that's not what I'm interested in emphasizing, and to be honest, it doesn't make me feel better. I already know other people feel similarly to me, I already know that, but I also know that everyone's experience is different. People go to these pages to feel less alone, and it does help slightly, but that's not enough. I don't care to hear that I'm normal, it just feels minimizing. I want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so, even when I put myself out there and have conversations, I feel like I'm not really there talking to them, and they're not seeing me. My therapist wouldn't even see the AVPD, she thinks I just have depression. I don't know what to do, I'm scared to open up to her about my concerns, I don't know how I would do that.

Stress about just anything in general.. too much of it

Difficult to have own opinion, I doubt if I even agree on the way that I feel or think about a certain topic at times. I believe this stems from stress

Depressed.. sometimes I just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. Occurs usually when I’m around people, and gives me a feeling of desolation like I am emotionally alone in my own world

Guys think of any moment you’ve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. Now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy, that’s where I strongly feel stress inhibits us and we don’t even bat an eye and question it.

I should learn to live with it.. it’s so difficult to live this way, we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have, but doubt lives upstairs from us, casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..",Personality disorder

The prevailing attitude over at r/schizoid seems to be this cavalier stance that loneliness is just a preference. Well, I take issue with this. Myself, I've been isolating on and off so much since even before puberty. Sure, it kind of feels good to not have to spend cognitive energy on social stuff. But loneliness is taking a toll on me. My brain operates on ""use it or lose it"", and I feel that now more than ever. Especially since covid-19.

The more I isolate, which is something I can do day to day without sacrificing too much in the short run, the less high functioning I become.

do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures?

while I’m here, I have one other question. I notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment. that is to say, I don’t take discomfort well at all. I don’t cope with thoughts like “it will be over soon” “next time won’t be so bad” because I can’t get myself out of the suffering of the here and now. for my life, this makes working hard, which makes money hard, which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness.

I abuse dissociative drugs for this reason, it’s the only possible way to escape the reality of the present, which is often uncomfortable. the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively, and see the beauty and humor in life, how small I am and how big everything else is, things like that.

But he was my good friend I have to say, he knew that I was shy and weird, but he always called me out to meet with people.",Personality disorder

Thought it might bring more awareness for yall, especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it (undiagnosed), this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM-5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

50710,"Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza (it was good though lol) I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake (also good). I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my mom

I dont have many friends besides a few online friends, and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me, it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me, but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their lives

To make this worse, my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist, especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot, and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd, they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...

This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected 🫠",Personality disorder
51377,"studying makes my AvPD symptoms worse. This might sound really weird, as I've never heard about it here or anywhere else, but I've noticed that when I make a mental effort, especially to learn something new, I seem to change my personality and I can't laugh , I get ""surly"", my mood gets worse.  Also, I get hypervigilant when I see people on the street, I look at them as if I've seen something scary.  If I don't study for a week, my symptoms improve a lot and I become more sociable and relaxed.  ps: Studying means being focused for a period of time on trying to absorb some content well, as mathematics or philosophy, for example.

51818,"Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not, if it's imposter syndrome, if it's from old Christian mantras of ""put others before yourself"" being baked into my psyche since childhood, or if it's a combination of all three; but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members, close friends, or co-workers, I often get this sense. 

I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line, almost ready to go-live with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover, I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. 

With friends or family it often comes in the form of ""should I be there?"" or ""I know I be there, be present, but I really don't want to"" and then I just feel like a POS terrible friend/sibling/son/etc. for not doing it. For example, a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally, I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went;  I asked ""who was there?"" and he said ""Just about everyone. Except for you"". I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty, but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it, but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though, again, this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. 

Another example is a friend, a close friend, who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that, because I need it, and it's nice to be included/wanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone; because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. 

Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder, or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?",Personality disorder
51772,"I look like how I want to. So, this is actually something really positive for me, even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. 

I was going to the bathroom, and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine, but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. 

Anyways, what I'm getting at is, I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in, and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look, my hair is long and messy, and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy, I like feeling cute, but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. 

But when I was admiring myself in the mirror, I lifted up my hoodie (no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie) and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course, I don't eat much, and I still function fine, so I guess that's okay. 

What I'm getting at is, I was able to look at myself in the mirror today, and I liked what I saw, and people can think what they want, I look exactly how I want to look today, and I love that.

Things have really been getting better for me, and though there's still plenty of low points, I can easily see my condition is getting better.

51035,"Feel like a piece of shit I (23F) don’t know how to explain myself to the people closest to me. When they look at me they see potential and they figure I should be more independent. I graduated college in December and my family, although they won’t say it to my face, expected me to land an impressive, stable job right out of college but they didn’t realize (and I know this is mostly my fault because I never really opened up to them about it) that my avoidance got progressively worse as I went through college. 

I never made any friends. Not one. Always too self conscious and awkward. I don’t talk to anybody I met in college. I was even on the volleyball team and never got close to any of my teammates over the four whole years. Only kept it amicable and surface level. Always to scared to open up. I grew progressively more lonely as the years went on. I felt a lot of shame about my lack of social life and made sure to never really bring it up around family when I would see them over break. I figured all that mattered was that I get good grades and work hard in volleyball. Besides my social anxiety and depression would be so overwhelming most days, the only thing I felt like I had the energy for was school and sports. I was constantly overwhelmed and didn’t have the energy, desire, or confidence to be social. The worst part was hiding this part of myself from family. Always feeling like I’m constantly hiding. 
I basically just went through the motions in college but that’s honestly all I had the energy for.  It felt impossible to dream up a future, a career, because I was just trying to get by each day. I would always (and still do) feel guilty for wasting my time in college. For passing up dozens of opportunities that were right in front of me because of my avoidance and fear. 

So it’s been three months now that I’ve graduated and I still don’t know what I’m doing with my bachelors degree. I know I’m letting my family down.
I’ve been living in my mom and stepdad’s house since I’ve been out of college and I only recently got a job at a cafe and everyone seems to think I’m selling myself short, doing the bare minimum. The thing is, this job was basically handed to me because my mom is one of the managers and they were desperate for people. I only just started this job and dealing with the customers has been hell. But I thought this would be a good way to finally step out of my comfort zone. Even if I’m not using my degree yet at least I’m earning my own money right? Wrong. It doesn’t feel like enough. I suppose I feel pressure to live up to other people’s expectations of me. But I also honestly know I should be doing more. I should have a license, a social life, an exciting job, more independence—but there’s something wrong with me, something missing. I know I should have more compassion for myself but that’s really hard in the position I find myself in. 

I’m honestly more frustrated with myself than anything. I feel intense shame about my lack of social skills and general fear of people. This simple cafe job even feels like too much for me because of all the interacting with customers, which only fills me with more shame and frustration. If I can’t handle this job then what can I handle? I feel stuck and hopeless. I think I might be looking into a therapist so there’s that.

51848,"Conversations Anybody else feel like they don’t have the natural ability to have good conversations?

Whenever I’m having a conversation with strangers, I’m often pretty quiet and I don’t know what to say (unless it’s work related or something I’m really familiar with). I think this is normal with society anxiety though

But whenever I have conversations with a group of people I’m comfortable with, like my family, I feel like I suck at having conversations. If it’s about a topic I don’t care about, I always zone out or stare at out the window. If it’s about a topic I’m interested in, it’s so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn (I can wait but it stresses me out and it’s hard to jump in sometimes). It feels like I’m going to forget what I was going to say or they’ll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk, I feel like people don’t really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations, sometimes it’s just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background.

51186,"I feel out of place, no matter how much I try I recently signed up for uni, and the first two weeks have been okay, if only I'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them.

I still managed to befriend two or three people. I try my best to talk to them, but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. So I end up feeling out of place because I can't gather the courage to talk more, while they all befriend each other.

Despite all of these feelings, I kept pushing through and this last weekend I managed to ask one of my classmates / friends who I considered myself to be the closest to to hang out, and they accepted. It went well, we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. But when I came back home, all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice, or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me, realizing I'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind.

I tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as I could, but today I already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. I saw my friend (?) enter class, but I couldn't bring myself to talk to them. Not even a single greeting, nothing, and I felt like a piece of shit for not trying more, because surely they thought I was rude for not saying anything. They were talking normally to other people during break time, and I envied all of them. I wish I could talk so easily with other people, befriending them. I wish I wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. 

So I ended up feeling out of place, again, despite my desires to fit in.

I thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. No. All I could manage to mutter was a half-cut word before they said goodbye, even if smiling, and walked up to someone else to talk to them. My logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class, but my AvPD says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore.

I feel like I messed up big time and that I lost a potential friend. I feel like I lost all my chances of having friends ever again, even. And I know it's my fault because I should have talked more, but when I talk more I'm scared to scare them all away. I hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. I feel like I'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored, even if the person is a friend.

So I don't know what to do.

51196,"Does your anxiety , fear of judgment ,rejection or humiliation stop you from doing daily basic tasks ? Do your triggers replay in your mind constantly ? I can said I have hight functioning AvPD. I go to work , teach my classes .I'm constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a Latin American country. 

But a few things happened while in quarantine , I was depressed , isolated with my family, grieving that a part of my body wasn't functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all. She hurt me terribly. 

Anyways , as I isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as I was bragging a lot due to my  financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at 22. I know that's awful  and was against my original principles but I  think I just tried to cope. I'm more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame. Like ""You can laugh or make comments about me ,but you are average and I'm not"". 
I started working at higher education by the time . 

I feel so much shame after all that happened and my avoidant traits have gotten even worse. I barely leave the home. I just go to my job, go home and repeat the cycle everyday. I am going through some medical difficulties  nowdays and I have to come to the realization that I can't live like this anymore. This is not life. I don't do anything else apart from working and existing , I cannot practice any hobbies or watch anything cuz I think that if I sing in portuguese or Spanish or English somebody on the other side of the wall is gonna be ready to laugh at me. 

I don't even talked to my parents ,unless I feel sure nobody could hear us. Sometimes I try doing something and past memories come to hunt me . I tried moving out on my own ,but the fear of being judge for being a female living alone and not talking to anyone has taken me out of the apartment and I've been paying it for two months now, without living there.

51827,"Hopelessness/Too lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try; too late to get treatment; too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is ""too badly off?"" I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be *nobody*. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up (or developing) AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.

Most subs seem to skew younger, which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness?

I catch myself saying a lot of ""mmm"", ""yeah"", ""it's true"", ""I agree"" but not something... substancial, you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like ""yeah, yeah"".

Meanwhile, when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say, some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going, and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can, and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.

Some time ago I created a personal ""system"" to help me ""fill up silences"" and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where: **1. just think out loud without filtering so much** (I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes ""think with their mouths"" while introverts think first, then decide if it's worth sharing - and for us with AvPD and/or SAD we mostly decide it is not -) and **2. look for a subject connection, even if it's minimal, then be like ""this reminds me of..."" and keep going about it**.

When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot (naturally; I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice) but even with this system, I'm still having problems because, like I said, a lot of times I simply can't think of anything.

I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is ""Am I that reprehensible?"". And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2-way street? 

I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.

Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another one-sided thing. It's such a slap in the face, like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.

These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing.

I woke up today finally having had enough with starving. I was on my way to the store, for the first time in a month (I’ve only been running low about a week tho), when I got this text from my dad: 

“Do not spend any money at all this week.  Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately, you have gone through the remainder of the ‘borrowed money’ from the loans I took out. And you didn’t get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.”

I’m backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left, I have no money, and I can’t bear the judgement. It feels like I’ve already lost everything, now they’ve even taken *my food?* I can’t do anything about it in this mental state. They don’t even know I’ve already failed out of my semester and can’t leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings.

51025,"I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni (not doing well) and today I decided to show up to a lecture, a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it (to put the attention on me) in Snapchat. 

I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. 

When I think about it, it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out, the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. 

I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird, even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward, I lack social skills, I am anxious and get panic attacks (emotional flashbacks) when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person (have no consistent sense of self). To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities, lack of social skills etc. 

By avoiding situations, I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed, and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird (think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis, or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street). Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.

Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed, insecure, weird, antisocial, a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule, mockery, disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.

I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglect/abandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. 

The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do, pointing out the weirdness, the odd one out, the undesirable. 

It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird, it's normal, they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep, on the odd one out. 

If I had healthy parents, good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person, heck I even have judged many people for being strange, undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.",Personality disorder

But I resonate a lot with the stories and thoughts/feelings I have read from people who have AvPD and a lot of it sounds like things I have said/thought/felt almost word for word.

I'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if I'm being over-dramatic. I won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why I'm a loser, but I basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom (""it's your fault for being upset"") and an explosively angry father (taught me it was NEVER ok to say ""no"").

It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school, but even back then, even in elementary school, I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often, I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation, lol.

I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here, since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19, I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to, but the only other option was killing myself, which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention, but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.",Personality disorder
51021,"'chicken or the egg' situation- do I treat the physical symptoms (panic attacks) or the core issue (childhood trauma/feelings of inadequacy) Due to an array of weird circumstances, I am a manager. A manager with avoidant personality. A manager who can't even say hi to her coworkers or ask for help. A very necessary skill for a manager. A manager who is visibly pushing down a panic attack each moment, choking on words and shaky hands. And you're too scared to ask to step down bc you already done so 3 times..

I have no idea whether to tackle the somatic issue, my panic attacks/nervous system arousal or the core issue, which is my feelings of not being worthy. I feel like I am inherently toxic and cold. I never say hi to anyone, even though a manager should be approachable and amicable...

I will say; I focused a bit on healing somatically/the physical symptoms. At least with somatic healing I don't lock down and go onto a full blown panic attack anymore, where I am mute and shut down. I know my limit.

I been a manager for a year now. I been avoiding my family, my career is falling apart and I have lost all my friends. I need help but I feel like financially it is not possible. 

I want to be medicated but SSRIs didn't do jack for me. Weed just bites you in the long run. Not sure if meds can ever really heal this. I just want to stop having panic attacks. But i know my core issues/inner monologue ans my unprocessed childhood trauma are what kick me into panic mode everyday. Panic mode makes me mute and silent, which peoppe percieve negatively.

It’s even worse when I think about how much I suck, and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden, because plainly I am pretty stupid.

51242,"Why can't I do just one thing? So, I've posted here before, but here we go again:

I work on hobbies, skills, and side hustles very intensely, but never intensely enough to do anything with them.  I have a degree in music education so I'm really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which I can learn them effectively.  I am capable of picking things up very quickly.  It's almost like the huge, dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that I crave.

The problem comes when I hit a plateau in improvement.  These plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally.  Due to my super sick AvPD tendencies, this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection.  I'm aware of how ridiculous it is, but it continues to happen.  At this point I basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new.  Whether or not I retain the knowledge from my ""fixation"" is anyone's guess.

What should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency.  If you continue to chip away, those vast improvements will happen, but over a larger timespan.  I am unable to achieve that consistency because my AvPD tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill.

Ideally, I wish I could just spend months and months, even years, fixating on doing just one thing so that I can actually see these trees bear fruit.

Here are a few examples of what I mean:

\- Contemporary/Jazz saxophone/bass.  Have the skills/knowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings.  Can't use these skills because I lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly, network, and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings.  The intense social aspect of the jazz/contemporary music scene also triggers my AvPD tendencies.

\-Youtube/Video Editing/Content Creation - Built a youtube channel, totally unrelated to music, from nothing to monetized in less than a year, with almost 100,000 views.  Lots of potential for growth.  I taught myself and know my away around Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, with knowledge of basic filmmaking/editing techniques, audio engineering, etc.  Again, I wish I could just completely no life this and make it blow up, cause I know I could.

\-Programming/Tech  I've taught myself, in a short time frame, a lot about programming, as well as the industry best practices and standards.  I know for a fact that if I could just do this every day consistently, I could turn it in to a career.

I wish I could just pick one of these things and go hard at it every single day.",Personality disorder
51732,"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah, I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic, I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder
51806,"I can’t sustain long conversations It doesn’t matter who the other person is, if we are engaged in a conversation, the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok, then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking, I start observing myself. 

The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear, my ears turn red, my lips start to shake, my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. 

Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person, this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. 

Later on as days pass, I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. 

After sometime, I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment, over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. 

I am 56 and have been like that since High School. 

Some medications have helped, particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously, but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes.

I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed, so I can get help, but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide, even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family, sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.

Anyways onto more non-death related shit, earlier I ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. I really hope they got the note, cause I look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. Besides my apartment looks so bad I'd rather not have anyone look inside, so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.

That's all I have for today, besides all the shit everyone here struggles with, I wish you the best possible day",Personality disorder

Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive.

Beyond on the symptoms, I've dung into the roots, the commo thought patterns, behaviors, etc. It's not something I feel will pull me down or become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as painful as it's been to learn about, it's something I feel refreshed by, in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself.

But then I met a guy that made me feel loved, like I deserved to be loved, for the first time in my life. 

We dated for 6 months, then he broke up with me, because I have a personality disorder. I never told him I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD, because even though he told me he would always love me, I was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. Turns out I was right. Because I finally decided to tell him about a week ago, 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. He said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. I asked if I did something wrong, but he said he just didn't want the ""drama"". 

I know I didn't do anything wrong, I never did anything to hurt him. But just because I've been through shit he doesn't want to love me.

51506,"How do you even expose yourself to the public or gain ""experience"" when you are 30+? I have been hiding from people for so long. Even when I was going to school I was finding ways to hide from the world. 

I got sad again and randomly searched ""avoidance"" on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.

I don't really play video games anymore, but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people, so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction + avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass, but on the other hand, I can see a lot of introverted, smart, but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people, even the ""lazy"" ones who never amounted to anything in life.

Now, the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life, so they don't really struggle early in life, but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their self-conscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience, not intelligence in order to succeed. 

I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.

But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again, this could be due to ""experience"" and desensitizing himself, but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me, my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.

I think about how nothing I do will ever prevent me from dying, and really, it is the only time I feel so...human. I feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing I ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. 

A hundred years after I die, what should I care? I'd be dead, so whatever I do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. Besides, by that point whatever hopes I had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. 

What I'm getting at is, I'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. It feels very human to me, that feeling of nigh nothingness. 

That is why I'd consider myself religious, because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about, and that the things that I do will matter for the rest of eternity.

 I know it sounds crazy, and people have told me repeatedly that I'm stupid for believing in anything, but what else do I have? I've gotten as close to the edge as I could before, just to see if I would do it. Clearly I didn't, but if I didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it, well, you know. 

Anyways, what I'm getting at is that I'm religious because it makes me feel wanted, like I have a purpose, even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. 

I hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too, because I can take a good guess at what my life would look like if I didn't have my faith.

And for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion, I'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. Nobody should have to experience that. And I hope you don't think any less of me for my faith, I wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me, and I don't get to choose how you live your life.

And god it's fucking hard not to see this whole country as a country of neo nazis. No matter how much I try to focus on the positives, all I ever see is people in Pro-Russian protest or people attacking alternative bars or spraying neonazi symbols on city walls. 

It's endlessly fucking depressing. And any time I complain about it to people they all say ""Oh don't look at it like that. Not everybody acts or thinks the way they think"". But it's so hard not to. It feels dishonest and fake not to. 

And I already have trobules with being social and opening up to people and now there's always this layer of ""Oh well I gotta be cautious with what I say about what I think because any person could hold back some fascistic views"" . With men especially. The men here are a whole different kind of intolerant pigs.

It's so bad that I'm constantly undervaluing my own opinions and thoughts. It fucking sucks. I never verbalize what I think or feel, because this whole culture is built on constant arguments and belittlings and wanting to prove yourself right that it gets so exhausting to socialize. 

And I want to socialize. I desperataely want a friendgroup, and a circle of people I'm comfortable with because I have none of that right now, and it sucks because I can't even break out of that caution to even begin to start looking for people. And it's so hard not to filter people through an Ideological Filter because that's always what it boils down to.

I don't want to care this much.

I want to just fuck off the world and just be me. And I can't. I want people. I don't want to want people. It's so fucking  lonely.",Personality disorder

If I say that I am a worthless subhuman, most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value, and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence. And while it may be theoretically true, it's also easy and generic.

What is difficult is to *feel* that you actually have value, when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person, but frankly, I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality. People forget about me, and that's totally reasonable. Everyone likes me, but not really. No one cares about me or is really interested in me.

I have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes I'm not sure if I need human connection anymore. But I find myself craving external validation.

50742,"Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if it’s an AVPD thing, but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my (very few) friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were *really* horrible, like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course that’s not real. I can’t believe I said those things to people, but it felt like the only way at the time.

Through a lot of reflection, I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person, because I didn’t deserve them. But nothing in my life (that I understood at the time) was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if you’re not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge, it’s not a valid mental health condition. I didn’t think I had any reason to have the problems I did, so I had to give people ‘fake reasons’ to make them believe it, because my parents told me that’s the only way.

Also somewhat of a test, like if they stay for this horrible person I’m pretending to be, they’ll surely stick around for who I actually am if that’s better. And it’s not hard to be better than that, given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave, then I’ll have been in control of the rejection.

50664,"Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.

 I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.

It’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.

As I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because 
1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.
2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.
3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.

But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.

I’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.

I wonder if I could've turned out better if I had been diagnosed earlier, since I've basically wasted my entire life so far. Only good part was some part of my 0-9'th grade, since it was a private school that had good experience with a bit different kids (not a special-school, but nevertheless a good school for me).

I seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is “I hate it” and 10 is “I love this and will skip sleep to do it”, the highest I can get is like a 7.

51144,"Social anxiety-geared remedies and treatments have made things worse **Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.
Also, long post alert. This is something that’s been brewing for a while that I hadn’t been able to articulate until now.

I’m 24 years old. I’ve been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years, I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. 

For example, public speaking: I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. 

So, I did the following: joined the media club in high school, where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college: I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs, and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. 

Let me tell you, it did NOT get easier y’all lmao. I swear to god, I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills, but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand, staying up and ruminating after, shaking, emotional anguish, insomnia, the works. Like I’d argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it, and i’ve received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like, probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well, I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus I’m not sure how much I trust the positive feedback I’ve gotten. I can accept that I’m an effective speaker, but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. 

So, public speaking hasnt gotten easier. I’m out of options. And it’s frustrating that no one around me understands this because, to them, I’m a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now… I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame, embarrassment, regret, anxiety, etc. 

I wish i’d never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fuck’s sake, I’ll get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straight-up ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. 

It’s not just public speaking. Its making friends, joining clubs, volunteering, working, the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation, I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again, even though I know I’m capable of them. I just don’t want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full, like I’m out of storage space. I’m just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. 

I feel like I’m destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. I’ll never be like I once was, and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anyway—like I was about to quit my job (or get fired) and possibly school because I couldn’t handle the hole I’d dug myself into.

I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious, especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.

It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectly:

&gt;I have trouble talking to women, in fact I can't even make eye contact with them, especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.

I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women, IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. (Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someone)

I know that I should try to make friends with women first, but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women (let alone having female friends or a relationship). It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.

51444,"Anyone else here forever alone? Usually I’m fine, I’ve known I’ll be alone for years, but sometimes the reality of it all comes crashing in. I have so much love to give, but il never get to experience it, being wanted by another person, being loved or being able to love. The thing that 99% of the population will experience, i am denied access to because I happened to receive some shit luck from the universe. How am I meant to accept that? I’ve watched my friends who were just like me, grow into capable adults, experiencing relationships and new friendships while I haven’t moved at all. I’m still the same stupid fucking kid I was at 16, terrified of the world and all the people in it. I am certain my brain wasn’t built for life, not in this world.

This disorder is fucking brutal, it’s completely ruined my life, all I wanted was to be normal. But now I’m doomed to this loneliness for life. And I can’t ignore it, every piece of media, every time I leave the house, there’s love and couples everywhere. And I’m not mad at them, good for them, I’m just struggling to accept the fact that everybody else gets to experience it and i happen to be one of the unlucky few that doesn’t, all thanks to avpd. It hurts too fucking much, the loneliness eats away at you, all I asked was to feel wanted or validated by even 1 human being but apparently even that is too much. It’s not even about the sex at all, I just want to feel someone else’s warmth, have somebody fall asleep on my chest, feeling safe and secure in my presence, trusting me enough to open up to eachother. 

Avpd is so horrible, this loneliness will 100% drive me to suicide, I’m not far off as it is. No human was meant to live like this, I wouldn’t even call it living. Sure you can survive with avpd, but I don’t think anyone can really say they’re really ‘living’, if I knew I was gonna have to live with this shit I’d have killed myself in the fucking womb, I wish my mum did, she deserves better. Sry for the stupid drunk rant, just had to vent it somewhere. I hate myself so fucking much, I never should have existed, avpd is just too cruel, how can this be my life, how am I mean to be ok with that, how am I meant to participate in society like every one else?  I wish I was dead, I should be dead, there’s just no point struggling with the rest of my life if it’s going to be alone.

50940,"My strange two-sided life Hi I'm (25 M) new to to this subreddit and also to Reddit. I am not diagnosed with AvPD so far but I am able to relate to almost all the posts here. My parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dad's side is fucked up. My dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder (Not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family). Everyone's super self-centred to the core. But it is the exact opposite on my mom's side. All of my mom's siblings, cousins and their kids get along great, while I feel like an outsider.

I was terribly bullied in middle school because I reflected the behaviour I saw back at home. Also because I had started watching porn. This went on for a few years. I learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self. This shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody, I repeat, nobody has access to the person within. I have since been the ""mature"" kid in school and focussed primarily on academics. I made it to one of the best universities in my home country. 

A couple of years into university, I realised that I had a lot of ""friends"" but there was no one I could truly call a ""close"" friend. No one knew anything about me. I ""collaborated"" with a lot of people, both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone. At that time I didn't think much of it, mainly because I was doing ""well"" according to the norm. I bagged some great internships and a well-paying job right out of college. 

Interestingly, this did not seem to affect my job. I performed exceptionally well and received great reviews, both in the technical and interpersonal front. But as you might have guessed it already, no one knew me out of work. Again, I ignored this and remained focussed on my work.

Then I decided to go for a master's and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the US. I have completed a term here. I started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people. It's not like I can't come up with things to talk about, but everything seems very superficial. There is no intimacy in any of the conversations. Also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me.

I am not really interested in people's life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise. What's sad is that from the outside it looks as though I'm doing great and living the best life. There are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what I have achieved. But no one knows the truth, not even my parents.  

This post is the most candid I have ever been in my life. I don't reveal anything about myself to anyone. I have never been in a relationship and at this rate I'm afraid I will never be. I want to turn my life around before it's too late. I'm not sure how my family would react to therapy. I don't have enough money to fund it myself.

To end this vent, the details I have added in this post are not intended for bragging. I totally understand that people have suffered worse. Those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect, two-sided mess my life has become.",Personality disorder
51778,"I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends, i.e. other outsiders. 

We'd meet to play computer games, or sometimes (rarely) go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?

Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. 

I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?

Consequently, friendship isn't something I've been looking for. Maybe if I knew what I'm missing out on, I would?

It was nice, but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life, that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20, over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric, and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend, let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point, the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.

Sorry for the melodrama. Point being, I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time.

51065,"Feeling guilt. I've had the perfect childhood, all the opportunities, great parents, a lot of friends (that even now, 30 years later are my friends). 

My parents supported me in everything, my mom is the best.

Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions (yes, weed is still an addictive drug) , partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. 
Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.

My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. 
It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. 
My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratom(legal). 
I feel normal and happy then. 
Me happy=my mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better, I don't want them to worry. 
I just want her to be proud, she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference, i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. 

Sometimes I can't clean my  house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.

So, if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean, even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.

She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. 
Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes, I'm not complaining about my life when I see them, I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. 
It's making things worse. 
Not for the outside world, they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.
I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. 
But that's not how it works. 
Now, if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes, kratom is a miracle for anxiety, depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom, going to a concert and seeing new people. 
On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos, talking, social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. 

My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace.

I've gone over this at least a hundred times, like tonight, even if I get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. I have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of Wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance, 12 stories might kill ol' Wiley, maybe, or leave him in agonizing pain, wishing for death. Imagine holding that little sign up to the camera, but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. Haha

But I'm pretty confident I'm going to get approved, I meet very criteria, I've tried all the required mental health options, counselling, therapy, community services, etc.  I don't have any psychological supports, I am alone. That's more than half the reason I want to go, this condition, this brain, it makes it so I will always be alone. The loneliness, knowing you can never and never will escape, you'll avoid every chance you have. But the pain doesn't have to be forever, I don't have to keep suffering, and if I don't get approved jokes on them. I don't need approval to kill myself, I just know I'm going to fuck it up anyway. Ending up with my ankles snapped off, trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. I couldn't do it if I tried, not because I don't want too. 

I want too, I want too so bad, that's why I'm applying for Maid, but I need to do it. But I will fail because I always fail. I'll avoid because i always avoid. I'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying TODAY IS THE DAY DO IT DO IT FUCKING DO IT PLEASE DO IT.  Constantly. That's my brain, thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. I love saying slit your wrists over and over again. Making tea, I should slip my fucking wrists, dum dum dum please slit your wrists. I don't even have a good knife, I just say it for some reason to myself.

I'm currently in Thailand on a six-week trip with my partner and child. While that sentence doesn't exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder, I am one of the most avoidant people on Earth. 

I spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people, none of whom I developed friendships with. I've spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that I can avoid any work environment that requires socializing.

But I am trying to make up for it, and I offered to do lunch Sunday (he's accepted).

I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder, and honestly, I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a ""well-meaning, but not getting it"" nod.

I have been diagnosed with AvPD for well over a year now, and I've been in therapy for even longer, so I'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing.

Going out feels like I'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and I just imagine myself as this gooey half-baked butterfly if I try to go out now. I want to get to my full form to go out and about. And I'm just not there yet.

But further, going out is a lot of ""things that could go wrong"" for me. Where am I going to put my car? (Ubers are a lot of money here). What happens if I leave it at his place but I want to go home earlier than him? Etc. etc.

51391,"I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional (and sometimes physical) neglect, I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always ""too much"". Too loud, too weird, too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to, but never did 

Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly, which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor (like grab something from a shelf) and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. 

This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go, I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions, because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number (we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him). 

He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves, I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't, so I *repeat what they said back to them* and they all give me this ""wtf"" look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. 

Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again, ending with people giving me this ""wtf is wrong with her?"" Look. Yikes. 

It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes *very little* for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child, which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always over-expressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness, I was crying, when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.

I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements (I still do but only at home lol). I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement, I started masking all of my ""quirks"", but I lost myself in the process. 

I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive, I isolate myself and I come off as cold, uncaring, and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly *do* care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem ""weird""

But anyway, I was wondering if people with just AvPD experience something like splitting (that occurs in BPD) after feeling like someone’s rejected them or criticised them.

For example, I was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and I really really liked them, but as the interview went on I felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me. After I felt that, it’s like a switch flicked and I hated them. Absolutely hated them. I was so mad internally and all I could think of was how mean they were (even tho they literally didn’t do anything). I was so angry and I just wanted to break down and cry because I also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired.

Anyway, I got the job and I love them again and can’t even imagine ever hating them. This sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and it’s so confusing!!! Except I thought it was only a BPD thing, or could it be a mix of both or complex PTSD??

Its justified because I keep making the mistakes I shouldn’t, and I feel stupid, alone, and nervous all the time. 

I thought about just trying to smile and improve. Even though my job is tough, I thought if I pushed through it would be okay. At the very least my co workers were nice. My supervisor doesn’t like me. But I’m getting more and more tired. It’s like the longer I stay the more my anxiety and depression flares up again. I keep avoiding people for no reason, trying to be alone in a workplace where there’s tons of people. When people look my way, I get so scared of what they are thinking. 

My hands begin to shake when I do tasks now. It’s quite silly because the only reason I am anxious is because of my own incompetence. I just think at this point it would be better if I just leave once my department hires new employees.

50783,"Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. It’s a shock to me, as well. But we haven’t had the greatest past. To make a very long story short: When he started medical school (4 years ago, when we first started dating), he wasn’t that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me, especially when he drank. Anyway, he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.

Now, my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still haven’t let go of the past. And the truth is, neither have I. I’ve forgiven my partner but I haven’t forgotten how everyone else treated me, even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school, seek any professional or academic opportunities… but mainly, it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply don’t trust anyone anymore.  

Today, my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents; and his friends were already there since they’re in the same class. Keep in mind that I haven’t seen anyone in about 2-3 years.  

After panicking for a week before the event, I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself it’s not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot, as well. Well….

Aside from my partner, everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone, and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke, they wouldn’t acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light, so he didn’t confront anyone. He did stick by my side, so I was at least grateful for that. 

It all just augmented my social anxiety, avoidant personality, and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me…. I’m really struggling to decide if it’s just a bad day or if I’m really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. 

My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that he’s grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes, ideally we would’ve never had to go through our dark phase. But he’s helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me.

My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her; I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts, interests and even my mental health struggles.  
I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life, but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything.  
Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment, when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities.  
I knew this day would come; my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend, but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone, abandoned and betrayed.  
She never mentioned that guy to me and my father; I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. 
I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship, but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything.

I can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought. Also the embarrassment when I only learned someone's wedding is coming when having a random group lunch, and learning I was not invited yet trying to sidestep other's question if I'm coming. I always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them, and always wondering why I'm not included. Maybe I'm too boring and not pretty/fashionable like them.

I've long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since I was a teenager. Always not being invited, being left out of information, or plain rejected to my face. I never have a romantic relationship, and no guys ever show interest in me. All the vague 'friends' term I use whenever I talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university.

* Spice and wolf

* Serial Experiments Lain

They are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it.

So essentially, I’ve been doing self sabotage. 

Now, the problem is that I’ve had quite a lot of absences at school, the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. 

I’ll need references for the application process, I don’t have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they don’t want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they (think they) know I’ll only mess things up. 

Honestly, I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow (would be a miracle in the first place) I’d somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again.

51562,"Question to people with AvPD Is it true that the significant difference between AvPD and SAD is that people with AvPD aren't interested in social relationships, whereas social phobics are indeed interested in those but their anxiety won't let them?",Personality disorder
51724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality disorder

51112,"Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations, or when someone is trying to sell something to you.

So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.

There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example, suppose I was buying something from a shop, I hand over my money, and then the shop keeper just ignores me, what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? 

Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place, they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.",Personality disorder

51290,"I wish they made a film centred around an avoidant character I’ve struggled to find any kind of media where the protagonist specifically struggles with avoidance. I really enjoyed Amelie and resonated a lot with the character, but feel that she could more easily be seen as struggling with ASD, or even just extreme shyness/ introversion. 

I don’t know about anyone else, but seeing characters I identify with in films or in novels brings me a lot of comfort. It kind of brings awareness to those traits and humanises people, and has the ability to shift the audience’s perspective on those issues. Maybe if we had more coverage in the mainstream we wouldn’t feel as defective or alien.

I’d love seeing an avoidant main character and having people really understand how severe this disorder can be and how overlooked it is. It could be painful, and raw, showing how damaging isolation can be yet how there appears to be no alternative. But it could also have light moments, and laugh-out-loud moments, and show how people suffering with this disorder have light inside them despite everything. 

I also think it’s important that the character be shown to be relatively attractive, intelligent, good work ethic etc. I think a large part (and maybe the most tragic) of this PD is that we view ourselves as less than we are. Almost like we have conditioned ourselves to not value anything about us, even if that value is present. I think people should see how the issue is deep rooted, and it’s not as simple as improving things like wealth, appearance or even social skills. 

I’m curious what other people think would be important to include in a film centred on a character with AvPD

Also, this song would definitely make an appearance imo

50693,"Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called *On The Outside Looking In* by Daniela Grazia, about her experiences with social anxiety. 

I’ve used it to describe my experiences to others, but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if I’m not explaining from the ‘correct’ side (?). I’m also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head, but it does matter.

The quote (one long one, formatting issues):
&gt;“It is a feeling that comes over me often, an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes, in coffee shops, in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.

&gt;”At any moment in the group conversation, something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking, and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different, a foreigner, an alien, a stranger in a strange land.

&gt;”And then the urge to run away, to hide, to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on, hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away, cursing the cowardice and the shame, miserable in my misanthropy, but secure in my solitude.

&gt;”There is something in the faces, in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves, I live inside myself. They talk, listen, and laugh; I think, listen, and smile.

&gt;”They are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed, except when I’m alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.

&gt;”Yet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely, desperately lonely, longing for intimacy, friendship and love. I long to be able to relax, to laugh, to talk, and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.

&gt;”Fear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me, gnaws at me, and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing, the desperate longing, the aching striving for meaning in life, for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged, the dreams unshared, the life unnoticed.

&gt;”When I am alone, I wish I was other people. When I am with other people, I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly, but ruthlessly destroying my soul.”",Personality disorder

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time.

48642,"I got extremely stressed in workplace and home. To speak I live in South East Asia, where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

48986,"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

Had to move to a massive uni to get the degree I wanted, but I was sick and exhausted and working and struggled to make friends. So im alone all the time. And there's always something that's wrong.

I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

Current Mental State// Life Problems: My dad’s company shut down over night 5 Years ago- both my parents  literally have  0 money and we come from quite a upper class background from back in the day. They have no idea how to move forward in the future, I’ve had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like I’ve only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. I’ve had men enter my lives, totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married / getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I can’t cope 
I run my own company and I’m independent enough to live my life currently - but there’s no security for the future and I’m just constantly feeling like I’m racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally - and if I don’t work I won’t be able to sustain myself. 

I used to be a go getter- constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on what’s happening to me .

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

For the past 7 years, that I have lived in my current city, I have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next, due to thinking it was a good idea to move in with friends to help out my crummy finances and needing cheaper rent. For the past almost 3 years due to the pandemic and other situations, I moved into a “rooming” type housing situation, which for the past 2 and a 1/2 years, me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves. Last July, my company announced that they would be laying off around 40 people, myself included. What my stupid company didn’t bank on, was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment, so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. When I found out that I was to be laid off  a year ago this July, I stupidly told the lady I rented my basement from about the news, but seeing how at the time, my company didn’t announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues, she took it upon herself and “guessed” that my end date would be around May of this year and I will have been moved out, so, she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. This was a major jerk move on her part. Seeing how I am really strapped for cash and couldn’t afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when I would actually be moving out, she offered for me to move into her “sunroom” this past May, until my end date, and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. My company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end August, this past May, and I unfortunately have to stay on working and living where I am due to those reasons. Seeing how this past year has been touch and go with NOT knowing when my company would announce this end of work date, and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening, I thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else, and have to sign a lease for however long, so seeing how I live month to month here, I chose to stay. Since moving into her “sunroom,” it has been a friken nightmare. She consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that I haven’t done. I am not allowed to flush the toilet unless “it’s brown,” she accused me of “killing” her precious plant, I have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesn’t come through the whole house…friken stupid stuff like that. She has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well, and drops stubble “hints” about how happy my dog is living here 😑 my dog and I will be relocating to another province to attend school, so I can upgrade my current skills at the end of August. Just this past Wednesday, my friend, got word that she has to go work out of town this week, so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place, to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. When I told the lady this, she mentioned how this wouldn’t be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dog’s routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friend’s apartment (meanwhile she has no air conditioning here). The first night there wasn’t so good, because my dog was in unfamiliar area, and she was all nervous and panting a lot. My dog has done this many times before when camping, or going away for a holiday…so I got her some “calming” spray to see if that would help. My dog and I came back to the house last night, because I have my car scheduled for servicing, and a garage which is literally 5 minutes away from the house, so instead of staying at my friend’s apartment, we came back here to sleep last night, for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. When we arrived back last night, the lady in question was like “ohhh she is so happy to be back” of course she would, she is in familiar surroundings…however, seeing how we’ll be moving at the end of August and staying in hotels over night and other friend’s places…staying at my friend’s apartment is a good trial run. When I mentioned that to the lady…she munched up her face as if to say “oh…I don’t like the sounds of this.” So, I am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me “why don’t you just leave your dog with me” and that is when I will snap.

49109,"Stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone Stress can be classified into three common categories:

* Acute stress
* Episodic acute stress
* Chronic stress

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of Acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

Acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

The sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

For example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* An approaching deadline
* Completing a challenge or receiving an award
* Narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* Rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

When your body responds to acute stress, it releases various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

Together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.

Studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.

For example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

This is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

This was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.

This could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress.

&amp;#x200B;

49431,"Can stress cause things like this? 
Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. 
And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues.

Background info: only experienced 2-3 occurrences where i found my legs specifically shaking due to nervousness. These experiences are spread very very far apart. 1st time over 10yrs ago fairly minor was just nervous about a new environment &amp; people. 

2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class, thought i couldn’t get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress (fear of being unable to catch up? Lost?) also deep slow breathing didn’t work here. How to manage lmao

Most recent was few days ago, no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time can’t really think straight, brain wasn’t calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing, had an IT issue i couldn’t fix, couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved.

I never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways. The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides, my tutor was good at helping me learn. 

I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester, and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.

The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place, but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours, I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord, and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem, but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.

Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. 

Aside from that course, I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful, they're also pretty difficult.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there.

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

My biggest symptom is **Extreme Fatigue** both physical and mental despite sleeping more.  I can't clench my fists as hard as usual to give you a scale.  I sleep more than normal lately and wake up very tired.

**Easily startled**.  I guess this means for some reason my guard is up.

**I'm very hungry**\-The sensation to eat is still there despite after eating a meal and my stomach being full.

**Disorientation**\- This one is hard to explain.  In groups of people I get confused if they are looking at me or the person next to me.  When I went out dancing and spinned I had a hard time not stumbling.

\*\*Mental Fog-\*\*I'm ""Spacey""

\*\*Irritable-\*\*I just feel like I've got bad vibes right now.  In situations I should be good spirited and I irritated easy.  A little inconvenience will feel like a huge problem.

**Headaches**\-I usually wake up with a headache.

**Low motivation-** I love to workout but I've been skipping days.  Very uncharacteristic of me.  Days I do go I force myself.   I'll procrastinate small easy projects.

48846,"Binaural Beats for stress relieve Hello Guys, We’ve haven’t seen anything related to binaural beats here, so I thought of sharing something that might be useful to you guys, because it helped me a ton. Binaural beats are claimed to induce various same mental states associated like reduce anxiety, relieve stress while increasing relaxation, increase focus and concentration, promote creativity, dreaming etc. In essence a binaural beat is an acoustic stereo signal, typically a sine wave, from which the left channel is slightly detuned to the right channel. This difference, measured in Hz, produces a waving motion that is actually audible when listened to on stereo headphones. This difference dictates the speed of the binaural beat which has different effects on your brain. Each frequency is associated with outcomes that correspond to different levels of brain wave activity. Here is a little guide on the most important frequency ranges:  


* Gamma waves: Between 30 Hz and 50 Hz, linked to higher alertness, concentration, and improved problem solving, learning, memory and mood.
* Beta waves: between 13 Hz and 30 Hz, similar to Gamma, linked to an active and alert mind,  improves mood and task performance
* Alpha waves: between 8 Hz and 13 Hz, indicate a relaxed and restful mind, can increase creativity
* Theta waves: between 4 Hz and 8 Hz, associated with drowsiness and meditation, reduced anxiety, relaxation
* Delta waves: between 0.5 Hz and 4 Hz, relaxation, deep sleep, dreaming

There is a lot of stuff on youtube you can check out and listen to. I mostly listen to binaural beats in the beta range for sleeping, meditation and lucid dreaming. After 10 minutes you really feel like your are sinking deeper in your mind. These beats are often accompanies by music playing on top of them, which is sometimes really nice, but we have a created a some natural ambiences that feature binaural beats.  If you want to check out our channel, you can do so here. We’d love to get feedback on those as well. :)

48830,"Managing Stress **STRESS..…STRESS…STRESS…STRESS…STRESS…..STRESSED!**

**Why do you think in this 21st century, from a child going to preschool to a retired person experiencing stress?**

*DID YOU KNOW?* As per the world health organization, 1 in every 5 persons (20% of the population) in India are said to be suffering from some form of mental unrest.

The world is running towards success and accomplishment. During this; we compromise on our health, sleep, food, relationships, and ultimately ourselves. Stressors are increasing which in turn results in stress!

YOU MAY ASK, WHAT DOES STRESS DO TO ME???

Well, do you have headaches, upset stomach, chest pain, loss of sleep, and high BP? Then, you have stress! Stress can increase your chances of having a heart attack by 25%, heart diseases by 40%, and stroke by 50%. Stress can lead to memory problems, inability to concentrate, poor judgment, negative thoughts, inability to relax, general unhappiness, and a sense of loneliness. Below are given some ways you can overcome your stress.

**EASY TIPS TO MANAGE STRESS**

Every individual has their own style of dealing with stress. However, there are basic guidelines for dealing with stress. Here they are-

* **Reframe** the stressor to see a whole new picture.

During a stressful situation explain the situation on a lighter note to yourself. Remind yourself to see life as continuous learning. Look at the positive side!

* Failure is a stepping stone to success.
* You failed so what? Get over it.
* There is no such thing as failure, only feedback.  

* **Journal writing is a voyage to the interior.**

Maintain a stress journal. Identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, keep track of it in your journal as you keep a daily log, you will begin to see patterns and common themes.

Write down-

* What caused your stress (make a guess if unsure)
* How you felt, both physically and emotionally
* How you acted in response
* What you did to make yourself feel better.
* **Test your thoughts.**

When something stressful happens. Assess what the outcome of the situation like its irrelevance, positivity, accuracy and the truth behind it. Like what am I think? Is it true? Could there be another way to look at this situation?.

* **Manage your time**. Stress is managed by simply planning your day well in advance. Like maintaining a weekly planner with all the deadlines, meetings, appointments, family time and most importantly don’t forget to throw some ‘**me time’** in there too.
* You **can’t control everything**.

Learn to let go of things over which you don’t have a control. Without forgiveness, we experience stress in a more raw, unblocked way. When in a distressing situation, pause, take slow deep breaths and tell yourself ‘**it’s okay’ I can move on.**

* **Count your blessings.** A powerful **antidote to** [**stress.**](http://www.cadabamshospitals.com/)

Learn to be grateful for what you have even if you feel it’s not enough. Tell yourself, I am strong and I will put my 100%.

* **Take time to relax**. **Ten minutes of quiet meditation** a day is powerful medicine. You can pray, listen to relaxing music or just simply focus on your breathing. Guided imagery, clinical [**hypnosis**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/therapy-types/hypnotherapy), and biofeedback are all useful for managing stress.

If none of the above works for you, then it is a good idea you get diagnosed with a good psychologist who can best help you in giving the right treatment for managing your stress.",Stress

49009,"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**",Stress

But the thoughts come more and more and I do not think it will be too long. I am trying to memorize things...how things feel, smell, and look. Subtle differences that we take for granted every day or miss. Like how someone is eyes light up or how a smile spreads across someone is face.So, my younger ones, think about your life. See the beauty in what you have. You have so much a head of you and there is much joy in this world. Love yourself.

10481,"Idk, I just feel like I need to say this, my mental state is going really really fucking fast downhill really fucking quickly. I have been struggling with this shit as long as I can remember, and I honestly can barely take it anymore. I have no clue why I have let myself live so long.my mental health is beyond shit, cronic depression or whatever the fuck it is. My social life, the only thing in life I have been clinging on to the past year, is also beyond shit. All of the friends I thought were my friends all ghosted me at once over the summer, even ones who promised me they would not ghost me like they always do. My home life is fucking chaotic and it only makes things several several times worse, believe it or not I am having some struggles when it comes to just being able to cope with the fucking abuse that gets thrown at me, like my therapist wants me to do. My physical health is the same, idk if I was just born different or whatever but my body's just fucked up. I am always in constant pain no matter what I do and it is just becoming too much to handle, you know, to the point of thinking death would be better than this.I can go on and on complaining about this shit, but apparently it is bad enough that I have been told to kms. Because it would put me out of my misery- not to be mean or anything. Yeah-Last time I was in the mental hospital for wanting to commit die, after kind of ranting about my home life my roommate was telling me that if I wanted to kill myself, they would support me fully.I have literally heard someone have a full on MENTAL BREAKDOWN because they thought that trying to convince me to not kill myself was selfish. Because they felt horrible for just making me suffer longer, and did not know if dying would just be the best option for me.I have shared these thoughts with people close to me and it usually ends with them giving up on me. I cannot count the amount of times I have heard stuff like this.Tell me death would not be the solution to all my problems. Tell me ending my life would not be by far the most effective way of no longer suffering, and fixing my problems. Tell me. I cannot count the amount of times I have been told to kill myself.

24074,"I am not actively suicidal, and I am not planning on trying to kill myself anytime within the next year or two, not until I start living on my own. The fear of failure outweighs my desire to stop living. But I have an entire plan for if/when I decide to do so. I am only 19, but I have typed out a will of sorts to let my family know how I want to be buried and where I want my money that I saved for college to go. I have a general idea of how I want to kill myself, where I want to do it, the time of day I want to do it, how Ill lie to make people not be concerned, etc. But even though this plan has only come to me within the last week, I have not been suicidal. I am just stuck in that awkward limbo where I do not see a point in living, but I do not see a point in dying. But I still cannot stop just creating this story in my mind of everything, thinking about everything that could go wrong and how I could prevent those things from happening and it does not really bother me.

16216,"I have been very active here recently but having somewhere to vent, somewhere where I do not feel alone makes the feeling alot easier on me I guess. This is not entirely related to the post, I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit. Its helped me alot.That being said I just saw a post on here, someone talking about being ""snapped out of it"" because they realized how much it would hurt their kid and it made me think about why I have not done it yet.My two brothers. One older than me and one younger than me. The older one tells me all the time that when I was born it snapped him out of suicide. His attempts were stopped by me crying as a baby, or even when I annoyed him he still loved me and wanted to stick around to see me happy or even just to annoy me. My younger brother has never expressed the desire to kill himself to me before, like I did to my older brother brother; but I have similar reasons. Truthfully, I like to fuck with him. Sometimes the funniest part of my day is me walking into his room, flicking his forehead and walking out. he is one of the funniest people I know and I know my death would ruin him. I have two sisters, neither if them are super in my life so I do not know for sure how my death would impact them but it helps to think they would be devastated too. I have a niece. she is a year and 7 months old and she is the cutest thing to exist. She cannot talk but I love my moments of communication with her. We play games together even though she cannot speak. Some sort of variation of simon says where she waves her arms and claps her hands wanting me to copy her. Sometimes she will turn of the tv when I am watching and look at me and laugh at me. Sometimes she does things and when I tell her to stop she looks at me and does it anyway. I want to see her grow up. she is so smart right now and I love how she is right now and I want to see her get older and I want to tell her stories about right now and show her videos of how she liked to just fuck with her aunt or how she would kiss her reflection.Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes I relish in the feeling that if I did commit suicide right now, people would be devastated. Sometimes I feel like that is the only time I will be loved by everyone unconditionally, and I feel like at my funeral, when it finally sets in, everyone will realize what they did wrong and feel remorse. Sometimes I think that if I died right now maybe in the afterlife I will have everything I want, including what makes me happy now. Maybe if I just did it I could have my cake and eat it too.This is a hard reason to have, because sometimes its my reason for wanting to kill myself and sometimes its my reason for staying alive. I want a better reason. I wish this was not my only reason but its kept me here for 9 years. Maybe if I had a better reason, the 9 years would finally be over and I could just live and be happy but for now I guess it will do. I wish I could find a better reason but if it works it works I guess.",Suicidal

18490,"I am going into senior year in high school this year, and for as long as I can remember I have just felt like I do not fit it. Like I do not belong. After a few years, I would say around 6th or 7th grade it turned into depression. I was seemingly indifferent to nearly everything imaginable. I was not sad, I was not happy, I was neutral. And it is been the same since then. I have no reason to not be happy. I live in an upper middle class family. Nice house, my parents are great, my older brother is as nice as an older brother can be. I have a nice job and get paid well. I am just not happy for some reason. I had friends for a while, but one day I stopped texting first and after a bit I never heard from them again. But the was okay, I am pretty antisocial anyway. it is been years since I had any real friends. I have never had an real interests, nor hobbies. I have done many sports, but only because my parents made me. I was just mediocre at them. I always just wanted to go home and go back to sleep. My latest sport I did was Mountain Biking, I did it 9th and 10th grade but quit before the season for 11th grade started. Since then, I have not done much. I just wake up, go to school/work, come home, lay in bed for a few hrs and eventually go to sleep for the night. Rinse and repeat. I do not know what I want to do as a career. I do not know what I want to go to college for, if I do go to college. I think id be fine majoring in whatever. I am not interested in pursuing anything, because I have nothing I want to pursue. I had never experienced suicidal thoughts until now, I think I was pretty content with my life up until a few weeks ago. Since then I have just found myself asking over and over, ""is this life really worth it?"" ""why should not I just do it?"" I have had a really bad time sleeping lately because of these thoughts. Hence why I am posting this at 1am haha. I have never self harmed before, never seen the point. Never had the incentive to. If I were to commit, I would want it to be quick and as painless as possible. I have thought it over a ton. I have been tempted to unbuckle my seatbelt while driving and just slam into a tree, obviously have not worked up the gut to do that yet. I have been tempted to use a noose, but I have not found a place to hang it. Lastly, I have thought of just slitting my throat. I think if I were to commit that would be the most likely because. Anyway, back to it. I do not have a reason I should feel this way, everything in my life is fine. And that makes me feel worse. It makes me feel guilty. And that guilty feeling does not help. it is just and endless cycle round and round. I thought maybe writing this down might help, and there was no reason not to so why not. I have no reason to be suicidal, but I am.",Suicidal

One time I just came home from school and she started screaming at me for something that was out of my control, and when I broke down crying, all my stepdad said was stop. The first time I tried to date, it ended with me on a call with the suicide hotline because she threatened to kill herself when I did not fight to stay with her. I only knew her for two days. The first person i kissed, the first person I cuddled with, the first person to say ""I love you"" to me, the first person I felt comfortable saying ""I love you"" to, turned his back and ostracized me from our mutual friends when I relapsed into self harm. My father sexually assaulted me while drunk when I was 12 and I still live with the repercussions. I could not even do my laundry because I had a mental breakdown. I could not stop reliving it. I could not stop thinking about how it affected my confidence and sense of self worth and still fucking does. All I could do was curl up against the fucking wall and try not to cry. I used to be terrified of people finding out somehow and I was scared that they would think that that was my awakening if i was ever outed. My only friend throughout high school does not ever ask me how I am doing and i cannot talk about being gay around him. He gets pissed or says he would not f me when i talk about it. Fuck, I cannot even meme about it without him arguing with me. My other friends, who do not know how bad this hurts, make jokes about how I used to force myself to be straight. They say things like ""remember when you tried to be straight? lol."" As if I could forget. As if I could forget the dozens of fucking times I locked myself in my bathroom with my knife for it.

11170,"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there. After a half-ghosted ""relationship"" ended I have been thinking about suicide for the past days",Suicidal

I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way. This is what throws me into a deeper pain because every time I dream of it I found that I will not be able to get.As I wrote in the title I do not want to die and I know that no one truly wants to die. That is why I wrote this here, to throw away the black goo which sticks onto my brain.&amp;#x200B;Btw is this well written enough to read? I rewrote this several times until I cannot make this better but still it looks rambling. Any insult will be appreciated. I do not want to kill myself, but I must and someday I will.",Suicidal

How can I be the bad guy, how can she hate me more that her abuser and her molester?What burns me the most is that hes gotten away with it, now hes happy with a new born. I am sure she is forgiven him, but I know she will never stop hating me, because my existence is a reminder of the guilt and betrayal she inflicted on me. Every time she thinks about me, she cannot accept the fact that what she did was wrong. But people will defend her. She was manipulated and abused I know her well, well enough to know that even now when she touches her self she thinks about him, the memories they had, how good it felt, the rush and excitement. And deep down she does not regret it. I cannot stand the fact that in her story, the one who loved her. I am the bad guy.

9948,I am at the fucking end i can not and want not to live anymore. Sometimes i laugh and be happy but that is just for short times because i do not realise the sadness when i am fake happy but i constantly have suicidal thoughts and often they are very strong. I think and plan for the last few weeks and constantly search for a good way for suicide but i think my perfectionism and ocd is the only reason because i do not find a worthy way to die. I am the person that searches for help but then does not accept it. I do not know what i should do i just want to dissappear in peace. being happy is like borrowing happiness and paying with sadness,Suicidal

We can hang out during the morning and feel just fine, but around the time they get sleep is around the time I start feeling suicidal. And so me trying not to bring it up is really hard to do and so I start acting weird and sad, which makes them kind of push away from me. Or maybe I just *think* they are trying to push away from me because I am sad and I am misinterpreting their tiredness. And then they go ""Alright, I am heading to bed!"" and I start dissociating. And I tell myself ""I cannot kill myself right at this moment, they are going to think it is their fault now."" so I do not do it, but I still feel overwhelmed by loneliness even though I am aware that *literally everyone needs to sleep* ! I guess I just want someone to look at me and go, ""you really look like you are struggling, do you want to sleep in my room tonight?"". I am not mad that nobody does this because 1. it might be hard for them to sleep when someone else is in the bed and 2. they cannot read my mind so how tf are they supposed to know that I feel hurt when I try my best to hide it?Basically: how do I stop getting triggered by very simple, small, harmless actions?

But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse.

I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this. I do not see any other way out",Suicidal

When I was in the 10th grade, I tried a percocet for the first time with a group of my friends. It was that moment that haunts my life to this day. I upgraded to straight fentanyl after a while, and it became apparent that I did not make enough to afford my addiction. After ruining about all of my relationships by either stealing or borrowing money from my closest family and friends, I went on to ask random strangers Id see at the gas station or distant colleagues. My life was shit before the drug usage. Parents divorced, dad a drug addict, mom a whore, and me a bipolar, anxious, scared person- there was not an absolute reason I should not be using in my mind. After a couple of years of failed attempts of being off and on sober, I decided I was going to end it all. However, that did not work. My tolerance was to a point that made it very difficult to OD on. On my final attempt, however, I bought 30 pills. Stimulus check helped me there. I drove to a spot that was public so my body would be found, and I snorted 15 of those pills. After woken by police, it was obvious that did not work the way I wanted it to. Court ordered to rehab, I went through the entire 3 month program flawlessly. Using my previous knowledge of rehabilitations spit outs, and a some what will to make myself better, I came out feeling sad. I knew Id miss my peers and even some of the counselors. That brings us to a year later. I have stayed clean, however I have had constant suicidal thoughts and plans circling my mind for months. I do not know if I should or not, but I just want this dark comedy of a life to end. My friends do not talk to me. I miss both my ex girlfriends.

19435,"I am twenty nine and I mostly want to disappear. I do not really want to die. What scares me the most is my ability to endure, and endure, and then endure some more. My life was designed to be shit from the moment I was born. My whole family is mentally ill; my mother is a bipolar who only got on meds well into her forties, my father is a high-ish functioning autistic, and my brother has had schizophreneia since he was fifteen. I have been abused by my parents for years, I have had two major depression episodes, one when I was twelve and one at eighteen, anxiety and panic attacks since I remember myself. I was never taken to a doctor as a child, I was seen by a psychiatrist later in life and was put on meds but could not tolerate them at all. I have never been in therapy. I have always been either overweight or skin and bones, I am socially awkward and too argumentative and bitchy and nerdy, all of which qualities are unforgivable in females who are not attractive. I have always been very introverted though it is not in my nature to be introverted, I have let people take advantage of me and I have abused myself in various ways. I never had an adult or older person who can guide me in any way, the only one for a while was my aunt, who would only help me financially, and since she told me that the reason she did it was so that I would be her nurse when she grew old, I have not spoken to her. I have only one friend, who lives in another city, who miraculously escaped the purge I did a few years ago. I literally cut ties with many people overnight in a fit of self respect. All my friends have been fake, because I do not have the ability to be vulnerable around people enough to form real connections. I have a boyfriend since three years ago who is from another country and I have not seen in a year and a half because of covid. I am a dropout, and right now I am completely broke and cannot work because of covid, and my boyfriend lost his job and is looking for one that will allow him to live overseas which seems impossible so far. We are both poor. Neither has a house, or money. I love him so much and he is the first person I was ever able to open up to the degree that I have. he is been with me through thick and thin, even though I am a horrible bitch and take out my anger on him sometimes. I am sometimes very toxic towards him. Intimacy often makes my skin crawl if I really think about it. He has his own baggage, but nowhere near as bad as mine. he is in therapy and keeps telling me I need to get a therapist. I think about breaking up with him all the time, because he deserves better. Sometimes I pretend to joke and tell him he should stay where he is and get a nice cute girlfriend with money, but I really do think about it. I think that if I do break up with him, it will have to be at a time when I will be able to off myself soon after, so that I will not feel pain for long. I have told him all these thoughts, and I think I freaked the shit out of him but he listened. he is the only good thing in my life, and that is why I feel like I need to protect him, by stepping aside.I feel like I am poison. I feel responsible for everything. Shame and guilt and the past stain everything. I have survivor's guilt over my brother, why did he get my mother's genes and not me? I have immeasurable anger towards my parents, my controlling psychotic mother and my father who has only checked in with his family to vent his anger. I feel contempt and envy towards sunny, happy people, even people with problems, even people with some problems, or one big problem. I am jealous of those too. I feel like no one can understand, I feel like no one has it as bad as I have it. Or maybe they do understand that is why they look at me with pity. I hate them, I hate people up close. The idea of people is much more appealing than the reality of stupidity, entitlement and selfishness. And yet am I any better? I want to disappear and fake my death and live away from society. I see people that leave everything behind and go live alone in some jungle or whatever, and I am so, so jealous of them. To constantly live in the moment, because you have no choice, because it is a matter of survival. I feel trapped and suffocating, and even though I do want to live, I want to be the person I feel I was meant to be, smart, funny, capable, I do not think it is meant to be. I feel like a naive idiot for having any dreams at all. I t does not help that I actually am naive and I have many life and money choices that really worsened things. I;ve been suicidal before and it was much more severe. I was this close and was stopped last minute. This time it does not feel urgent at all, it feels unavoidable. Steady but surely. The scary thing that I keep asking myself, is how much more can you take? The answer to that is: probably a lot more. And that I just cannot live with. I am emotionally burnt out. I am depressed. The thought of having to deal with anything is awful.I do not know why I am posting this. Probably to validate how shitty everything is. Everyone around me is acting as if nothing is wrong.

7641,"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

27071,"I have been having a very difficult 8 months, in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time. it is not something I have really talked to many people about, and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible, but have been having issues thanks to insurance. I kept telling myself ""if I feel this way in 3 months, then I will look into my options to end the pain."" And 3 months came and went, and I still felt that way. 6 months passed and I would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes, watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing I was not alive. 8 months went by in a depressive fog and I continued trying to give myself hope for a future, with very little luck. It has felt like despite trying to do everything right, nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor. This morning I felt the urge to end my life stronger than I have felt in my adult life. In a puddle of tears, contemplating how to take my life I asked myself ""what am I even living for anymore?"" And my phone rang. My phone ID showed the caller was my beloved sister who I have not talked to in months. I could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles, but hearing her voice saved me. And without knowing what I was going through, she delivered the words I needed to hear most. She gave me hope again when I felt it was all but lost. From one sad heart to another, *PLEASE* do not give up hope. The people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words. (I know this bc I have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways I still have not been able to fully process.) It may feel rough today, tomorrow, and possibly for years to come. But it does get better. Just remind yourself that you *can* do hard things, even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself. But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain, you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.My only advice is do not struggle alone, it makes everything so much harder. Call someone, anyone you know that cares, call a crisis hotline, write an anonymous post, go do something you love, try something new, but especially treat yourself with kindness. You are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life. You are human, and the human experience is a messy one. So, be messy, love. do not lose hope.",Suicidal

I started going to therapy last month or so and I was progressing well. I was diagnosed with dysthymia and I was going into a more stable and functional state. I started to do my schoolwork again and I was managing my stress and intrusive thoughts better. I was proud that I was recovering and I was so excited to getting my life back together. But I guess I spoke too soon and I ended up relapsing this week. I do not know what triggered it, but I feel like it happened because I had a lot of slip ups this week (like messing up while doing chores, upsetting a friend, etc.) I ended up planning out three suicide plans and writing a tear and snot soaked suicide note (pretty gross I know). I am pretty angry at myself right now, because I feel like I wasted the efforts of my therapist, my friends (who helped me a lot with dealing with my bad stuff) and I feel like I wasted my own effort. what is worse is that being angry at myself just fuels my desire to kill myself even more. I do not have the guts to tell my friends about what I am feeling or thinking cos they are going through their own problems right now and I feel ashamed to even tell them because I am an awful friend cos I suck at being there for them emotionally (I am still learning how to be empathetic and how to comfort others, nobody really taught me as a kid so I am still developing on that aspect). My family does not acknowledge I exist anymore, and I am falling behind my school work. I just want to end things, because I just do not have a desire to live anymore.

17781,"TW- Sexual AssualtI SAd my friend and I feel absolutely disgusting, I am not asking for absolution nor does my POV and context of the situation excuse what I did. I am asking what I should do as I cannot live with the fact I did this especially as I was already suicidal.I went out with friends and invited a friend I met on a dating app that I had known previously and was in town visiting, we got drunk and since she drove I told her she could stay at my place, prior to this night I had recently reconnected with friends after disappearing for months during a mental health episode and things looked up for once.This Is where I completely fuck up and I cannot believe I did this. After drinking with some friends at my place we cuddle and put on a movie, we were all over each the entire night prior to being drunk too, she specifically told me she did not want to have sex because she was going through a lot and recently attempted, I genuinely wanted to respect that and not make her uncomfortable so at this time I accepted nothing would happen although I did hope in the back of my head something would. We were cuddling and she told me she would take off her shirt because it was hot, I told her I understand and that I did not want to make her do anything she did not want to (although in the end I did). She then said that that makes her want to do it more (have sex) and I insisted I did not want to make her do anything she is uncomfortable with I should have stopped everything here in retrospect but given I was also intoxicated but its not an excuse. She layed on me and I played with her chest we then told each other some pretty vulnerable stuff like how I am a virgin.She said things like I cannot believe someone as handsome and amazing as you has not been with anyone etc. I told her I have a lot of trauma that made me shy around girls. I am not entirely sure what happened next but we made out a little and she ended up laying over my legs on her stomach I assumed she wanted to watch the movie. I began touching her more aggressively and took off her underwear the entire time I did not realize she was passed out asleep I thought she may have closed her eyes because as I touched her more intimately (but never putting anything inside her) she started to breath heavier. In hindsight should have not took this as consent. I stopped to get up, and saw her eyes were closed so I put a blanket over her it still did not click what I had done.She then asked a couple seconds after tucking her in why she had no underwear. I immediately realized what I had done was not consensual I started to apologize the best I could while intoxicated. But she was still half asleep. After apologizing profusely and waking her up she became very empathetic telling me that it was okay and she will not tell anyone and that I did not know she was asleep. I tried to tell her that it does not matter what I did was fucked up but somehow ended up with her embracing me and encouraging me to talk about the trauma I mentioned to her earlier so I did it was weirdly therapeutic and I was so confused because I just did something horrible to her.She ended up sobering up and to my protest she drove and I bought her food and told her how sorry I was agin and if there was anything I can do let me know before she dropped me back at my place. I stupidly texted her after not sleeping at all that She should let me take her on a proper date because she said she wanted to see each other before she left town I know I am a stupid idiot but I texted her that, she obviously declined and I knew she felt differently than when it initially what happened as she was probably sobering up and processing what happened.I told her I understand and that it was selfish of me to ask. She then sent me a longer text later in the day and it was that she felt violated and that I took advantage of her which I absolutely did. Despite that She told me that she genuinely thinks I am a good friend and hopes I thrive one day and get help but that she has to block me for her own mental health. I replied with a really long apology that I hope was sincere and understanding but it did not go through as I was expecting.I am not sure what to do now I have been a mess the entire day, I feel so fucking horrible for what I did its eating me alive. I was already pretty suicidal and had a really bad view on myself but I am not sure how I can move forward from this as I feel I do not deserve to.

9987,"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me. My whole living situation has really taken its toll on my mental health. Waking up in the middle of the night to a small noise, and then panicking that the ceiling's collapsed is awful. The last contractor in here said ""do not be afraid if it falls, its light weight material"" which just prepped me for it actually falling. Anyway, the city inspector is filing a report, and hopefully this will be fixed soon.

Say you survive, would you know better to finish the job, or would you just suffer?Everything has gone downhill since that year. I had a large group of friends that year who all cared for one another. We looked after each other. We had similar interested. It was fantastic! I had a phenomenal teacher that year. Our class was so close. You could chat with anybody. It felt like a miniature family. My family did not fight every day back then. There was an influx of video games to play. Content I enjoyed (both television and YouTube) was at a peak. I actually enjoyed playing Basketball.I had motivation to get out of bed. Lastly, have not been in a relationship since 2017/2018.

I have done that. He would call me later. Not. Then he was on vacation. This week he would be back and still have not heard anything. So I called. The assistent would ask him about it. Long story. I heard back and he would call me on Monday. So after 4 weeks of nothing, he let us me wait another weekend. And what will he say?You open up. You are honest about your suicidal thoughts. But do you get any help. No. I know medication will not help right away, if it helps at all. But to have at least someone care a little bit about your health, to have some try to help you. That would maybe give some hope. Now I feel all alone. It feels like no one knows what to do. And no one cares.it is fucked up. If you have some physical problem, you get help right away. My dad has an appoinment every few weeks. When he forgot about one, he got called where he is. That does not happen to me. Why? Because there is not a chance I could die? And then therapists/doctors/etc are shocked when a patient kills themselve.&amp;#x200B;I know I am just one of many who deal with this in my country.

I do not want to give myself false hope over getting back together either.And about being trans, I have came out to both my parents and although they are supportive I still fucking hate everything. Why could not I have just been born cis, why do I have to wait for therapy and then wait for my therapist to write a letter just to get on blockers or E? Why cannot I just be believed and allowed to transition? Why is it so fucking hard for me to talk to my parents about anything trans related?In the end I just want the suffering to stop. My ex was my world (as cliche as it sounds, I hate talking like this because it sounds so edgy) but seriously. She was the reason I stopped cutting. She was the reason I stopped disordered eating habits. I know it just happened and I can get over it eventually but I thought our relationship would never end.At this point I just want to die.

I live in the south and I am middle eastern, so most intersections I have with strangers are negative. I work in retail and wether or not I am working I get antagonized by random white people over the age of 30 everywhere I go. I mind my own business. One tim I had a gun (still in the holster) flashed at me in a CVS because I asked an old man if the wart remover he was holding worked or not. My dads an egomaniac so I cannot talk to him about it he just cares about being right (in his mind he has to win every conversation he has) so its always my fault. Well anyways I decided to get out of my she will a bit and try to be friendly so I baked some baklava, made three different kind of dips, made homemade chips, and went to the party. I worked out beforehand, made sure I looked nice, then went to bring the food to the party. No surprise but everyone was the typical middle class urburban type, and I felt like rector was staruing at me. I waved at a lady who was REALLY staring and she just turned away. Ok, whatever. Say hello to the kids playing in the driveway, they say hi sheepishly but no adult wanted to talk to me. I set the dip down tried to start a convo with some of the dads standing around, nothing but the cold shoulder. So now I am just home with some leftover baklava and dip. Is it my fault for only giving them like 15 minutes? I really tried guys I am an introvert but I tried so hard and it was so awkward. I felt like an alien everyone was looking at me studying me and no one wanted to talk to me. I might be looking too much into it but one guy I think actually walked all the way around the little tent table thing to avoid me, I only say that because it would have been wayyyyy quicker to walk past me. He half-stepped in trees and bushes. Idk. I know this is pathetic but I cannot help but feel so alone.
